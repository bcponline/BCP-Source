<p>Let us pray.<br/>
<br/>
Almighty God, we pray you graciously to behold this your<br/>
family, for whom our Lord Jesus Christ was willing to be<br/>
betrayed, and given into the hands of sinners, and to suffer<br/>
death upon the cross; who now lives and reigns with you and<br/>
the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever. <em>Amen.</em> </p>

<p>Dear People of God: Our heavenly Father sent his Son into<br/>
the world, not to condemn the world, but that the world<br/>
through him might be saved; that all who believe in him<br/>
might be delivered from the power of sin and death, and<br/>
become heirs with him of everlasting life.<br/>
<br/>
We pray, therefore, for people everywhere according to their<br/>

<p>Merciful God, creator of all the peoples of the earth and<br/>
lover of souls: Have compassion on all who do not know you<br/>
as you are revealed in your Son Jesus Christ; let your Gospel<br/>
be preached with grace and power to those who have not<br/>
heard it; turn the hearts of those who resist it; and bring<br/>
home to your fold those who have gone astray; that there<br/>
may be one flock under one shepherd, Jesus Christ our Lord.<br/>
<em>Amen.</em><br/>
<br/>
Let us commit ourselves to God, and pray for the grace<br/>
of a holy life, that, with all who have departed this world and<br/>
have died in the peace of Christ, and those whose faith is<br/>
known to God alone, we may be accounted worthy to enter<br/>
into the fullness of the joy of our Lord, and receive the crown<br/>
of life in the day of resurrection.</p>

<p class="rubric">Silence</p>

<p>O God of unchangeable power and eternal light: Look<br/>
favorably on your whole Church, that wonderful and sacred <br/>
mystery; by the effectual working of your providence, carry<br/>
out in tranquility the plan of salvation; let the whole world <br/>
see and know that things which were cast down are being<br/>
raised up, and things which had grown old are being made<br/>
new, and that all things are being brought to their perfection<br/>
by him through whom all things were made, your Son Jesus<br/>
Christ our Lord; who lives and reigns with you, in the unity<br/>
of the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever. <em>Amen.</em></p>
