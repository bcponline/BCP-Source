<p class="rubric">On this day, the Celebrant begins the liturgy with the Salutation and the <br/>
Collect of the Day.</p>

<p>Let us pray.</p>

<p>Almighty and everlasting God, you hate nothing you have<br/>
made and forgive the sins of all who are penitent: Create and<br/>
make in us new and contrite hearts, that we, worthily<br/>
lamenting our sins and acknowledging our wretchedness,<br/>
may obtain of you, the God of all mercy, perfect remission<br/>
and forgiveness; through Jesus Christ our Lord, who lives<br/>
and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever<br/>
and ever. <em>Amen.</em></p>

<p class="rubric">After the Sermon, all stand, and the Celebrant or Minister appointed<br/>
invites the people to the observance of a holy Lent, saying</p>

<p>Dear People of God: The first Christians observed with great<br/>
devotion the days of our Lord's passion and resurrection, and<br/>
it became the custom of the Church to prepare for them by a</p>

<br/>
<br/>

<p>season of penitence and fasting. This season of Lent provided <br/>
a time in which converts to the faith were prepared for Holy <br/>
Baptism. It was also a time when those who, because of <br/>
notorious sins, had been separated from the body of the faithful <br/>
were reconciled by penitence and forgiveness, and restored to <br/>
the fellowship of the Church. Thereby, the whole congregation <br/>
was put in mind of the message of pardon and absolution set <br/>
forth in the Gospel of our Savior, and of the need which all <br/>
Christians continually have to renew their repentance and faith.<br/>
<br/>
I invite you, therefore, in the name of the Church, to the<br/>
observance of a holy Lent, by self-examination and repentance;<br/>
by prayer, fasting, and self-denial; and by reading and<br/>
meditating on God's holy Word. And, to make a right beginning <br/>
of repentance, and as a mark of our mortal nature, let us now <br/>
kneel before the Lord, our maker and redeemer.</p>

<p class="rubric">Silence is then kept for a time, all kneeling.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 10px; border-left: 2px solid"><font SIZE="2"><em>If ashes are to be imposed, the Celebrant says the following prayer</em></font><br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; Almighty God, you have created us out of the dust of the <br/>
&nbsp; earth: Grant that these ashes may be to us a sign of our <br/>
&nbsp; mortality and penitence, that we may remember that it is <br/>
&nbsp; only by your gracious gift that we are given everlasting life; <br/>
&nbsp; through Jesus Christ our Savior. <em>Amen.<br/>
<br/>
<font SIZE="2">&nbsp; The ashes are imposed with the following words</font></em><br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; Remember that you are dust, and to dust you shall return.</p>

<p><b>Psalm 51</b> <font SIZE="2"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Miserere mei, Deus</em> </p>

<p class="small">&nbsp; 1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have mercy on me, O God, according to your<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; loving-kindness; * <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in your great compassion blot out my offenses.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; 2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wash me through and through from my wickedness *<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and cleanse me from my sin.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; 3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For I know my transgressions, *<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and my sin is ever before me.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; 4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Against you only have I sinned *<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and done what is evil in your
sight.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; 5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And so you are justified when you speak *<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and upright in your judgment<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; 6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed, I have been wicked from my birth, *<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a sinner from my mother's womb.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; 7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For behold, you look for truth deep within me, *<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and will make me understand wisdom secretly.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; 8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Purge me from my sin, and I shall be pure; *<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wash me, and I shall be clean indeed. <br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; 9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Make me hear of joy and gladness, *<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that the body you have broken may rejoice.<br/>
<br/>
10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hide your face from my sins *<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and blot out all my iniquities.<br/>
<br/>
11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Create in me a clean heart, O God, *<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and renew a right spirit within me.<br/>
<br/>
12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cast me not away from your presence *<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and take not your holy Spirit from me.<br/>
<br/>
13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Give me the joy of your saving help again *<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and sustain me with your bountiful Spirit. <br/>

14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I shall teach your ways to the wicked, *<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and sinners shall return to you. <br/>
<br/>
15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Deliver me from death, O God, *<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and my tongue shall sing of your righteousness,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O God of my salvation.<br/>
<br/>
16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Open my lips, O Lord, *<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and my mouth shall proclaim your praise. <br/>
<br/>
17&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Had you desired it, I would have offered sacrifice; *<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but you take no delight in burnt-offerings. <br/>
<br/>
18&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sacrifice of God is a troubled spirit; *<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a broken and contrite heart, O God, you will not despise.</p>

<p><strong>Litany of Penitence</strong></p>

<p class="rubric">The Celebrant and People together, all kneeling</p>

<p>Most holy and merciful Father:<br/>
We confess to you and to one another,<br/>
and to the whole communion of saints<br/>
in heaven and on earth,<br/>
that we have sinned by our own fault<br/>
in thought, word, and deed;<br/>
by what we have done, and by what we have left undone.</p>

<p class="rubric">The Celebrant continues</p>

<p>We have not loved you with our whole heart, and mind, and<br/>
strength. We have not loved our neighbors as ourselves. We<br/>
have not forgiven others, as we have been forgiven.<br/>
<em>Have mercy on us, Lord.</em></p>

<p>We have been deaf to your call to serve, as Christ served
us.<br/>
We have not been true to the mind of Christ. We have grieved<br/>
your Holy Spirit.<br/>
<em>Have mercy on us, Lord.</em></p>

<br/>
<br/>
<p class="rightfoot"><em>Ash Wednesday</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;267</p>

<br/>

<p>We confess to you, Lord, all our past unfaithfulness: the<br/>
pride, hypocrisy, and impatience of our lives,<br/>
<em>We confess to you, Lord..</em></p>

<p>Our self-indulgent appetites and ways, and our
exploitation<br/>
of other people,<br/>
<em>We confess to you, Lord.</em></p>

<p>Our anger at our own frustration, and our envy of those<br/>
more fortunate than ourselves,<br/>
<em>We confess to you, Lord.</em></p>

<p>Our intemperate love of worldly goods and comforts, and<br/>
our dishonesty in daily life and work,<br/>
<em>We confess to you, Lord.</em></p>

<p>Our negligence in prayer and worship, and our failure to<br/>
commend the faith that is in us,<br/>
<em>We confess to you, Lord.</em></p>

<p>Accept our repentance, Lord, for the wrongs we have done:<br/>
for our blindness to human need and suffering, and our<br/>
indifference to injustice and cruelty,<br/>
<em>Accept our repentance, Lord<.</em></p>

<p>For all false judgments, for uncharitable thoughts toward our<br/>
neighbors, and for our prejudice and contempt toward those<br/>
who differ from us,<br/>
<em>Accept our repentance, Lord.</em></p>

<p>For our waste and pollution of your creation, and our lack of<br/>
concern for those who come after us,<br/>
<em>Accept our repentance, Lord.</em></p>

<p>Restore us, good Lord, and let your anger depart from us;<br/>
<em>Favorably hear us, for your mercy is great.</em></p>

<p>Accomplish in us the work of your salvation,<br/>
<em>That we may show forth your glory in the world.</em></p>

<br/>

<p>By the cross and passion of your Son our Lord,<br/>
<em>Bring us with all your saints to the joy of his resurrection.</em></p>

<p class="rubric">The Bishop, if present, or the Priest, stands and, facing the people, says</p>

<p>Almighty God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who<br/>
desires not the death of sinners, but rather that they may turn<br/>
from their wickedness and live, has given power and<br/>
commandment to his ministers to declare and pronounce to<br/>
his people, being penitent, the absolution and remission of<br/>
their sins. He pardons and absolves all those who truly<br/>
repent, and with sincere hearts believe his holy Gospel.<br/>
<br/>
Therefore we beseech him to grant us true repentance and his<br/>
Holy Spirit, that those things may please him which we do on<br/>
this day, and that the rest of our life hereafter may be pure<br/>
and holy, so that at the last we may come to his eternal joy;<br/>
through Jesus Christ our Lord. <em>Amen.</p>

<p class="rubric">A deacon or lay reader leading the service remains kneeling and<br/>
substitutes the prayer for forgiveness appointed at Morning Prayer.<br/>
<br/>
The Peace is then exchanged.<br/>
<br/>
In the absence of a bishop or priest, all that precedes may be led by a<br/>
deacon or lay reader.<br/>
<br.>
The Litany of Penitence may be used at other times, and may be preceded<br/>
by an appropriate invitation and a penitential psalm.<br/>
<br/>
When Communion follows, the service continues with the
Offertory.</p>
