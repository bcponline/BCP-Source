<p class="rubric">There is no celebration of the Eucharist on this day.<br/>
<br/>
When there is a Liturgy of the word, the Celebrant begins with the<br>
Collect of the Day</p>

<p>O God, Creator of heaven and earth: Grant that, as the<br>
crucified body of your dear Son was laid in the tomb and<br>
rested on this holy Sabbath, so we may await with him the<br>
coming of the third day, and rise with him to newness of<br>
life; who now lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit,<br>
one God, for ever and ever. <em>Amen.</em></p>

<p class="small">Old Testament</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Job 14:1-14 <br>
<em>Psalm</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 130, <em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or</em> 31:1-5 <br>
<em>Epistle</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 Peter 4:1-8 <br>
<em>Gospel</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Matthew 27:57-66, <em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or</em> John 19:38-42</p>

<p class="rubric">After the Gospel (and homily), in place of the Prayers of the People, the <br>
Anthem &quot;In the midst of life&quot; (page 484 or 492) is sung or said.<br/>
<br/>
The service then concludes with the Lord's Prayer and the Grace.</p>
