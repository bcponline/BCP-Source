<p class="rubric">The Eucharist begins in the usual manner, using the following Collect,<br>
Psalm, and Lessons</p>

<p>Almighty Father, whose dear Son, on the night before<br>
he suffered, instituted the Sacrament of his Body and Blood:<br>
Mercifully grant that we may receive it thankfully in<br>
remembrance of Jesus Christ our Lord, who in these holy<br>
mysteries gives us a pledge of eternal life; and who now lives<br>
and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever<br>
and ever. <em>Amen.</em></p>

<p class="small">Old Testament</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exodus 12:1-14a <br>
<em>Psalm</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 78:14-20, 23-25 <br>
<em>Epistle</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 Corinthians 11:23-26(27-32) <br>
<em>Gospel</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John 13:1-15, <em> or</em> Luke22:14-30</p>

<p class="rubric">When observed, the ceremony of the washing of feet appropriately<br>
follows the Gospel and homily.<br/>
<br/>
During the ceremony, the following or other suitable anthems may be<br>
sung or said</p>

<p>The Lord Jesus, after he had supped with his disciples and<br>
had washed their feet, said to them, &quot;Do you know what I,<br>
your Lord and Master, have done to you? I have given you<br>
an example, that you should do as I have done.&quot;</p>

<p><em>Peace is my last gift to you, my own peace I now leave with<br>
you; peace which the world cannot give, I give to you.</em><br/>
<br/>
I give you a new commandment: Love one another as I have<br>
loved you.</p>
<em>

<p>Peace is my last gift to you, my own peace I now leave with<br>
you; peace which the world cannot give, I give to you.<br/>
<br/>
By this shall the world know that you are my disciples: That<br>
you have love for one another.</p>

<br/>
