apart from the church, so that all may go into the church in procession.<br/>
<br/>

procession may be distributed to the people before the service, or after<br/>
the prayer of blessing.<br/>
<br/>
The following or some other suitable anthem is sung or said, the people<br/>
standing</p>

<p>Blessed is the King who comes in the name of the Lord.<br/>
<em>Peace in heaven and glory in the highest.</em></p>

<p>Assist us mercifully with your help, O Lord God of our<br/>
salvation, that we may enter with joy upon the contemplation<br/>
of those mighty acts, whereby you have given us life and<br/>
immortality; through Jesus Christ our Lord. <em>Amen.</em></p>

<p>It is right to praise you, Almighty God, for the acts of love by<br/>
which you have redeemed us through your Son Jesus Christ<br/>
our Lord. On this day he entered the holy city of Jerusalem in<br/>
triumph, and was proclaimed as King of kings by those who<br/>
spread their garments and branches of palm along his way.<br/>
Let these branches be for us signs of his victory, and grant that<br/>
we who bear them in his name may ever hail him as our King,<br/>
and follow him in the way that leads to eternal life; who lives<br/>
and reigns in glory with you and the Holy Spirit, now and <br/>
for ever. <em>Amen.</em> </p>

<p class="rubric">The following or some other suitable anthem may then be sung or said</p>

<p>Almighty God, whose most dear Son went not up to joy but<br/>
first he suffered pain, and entered not into glory before he<br/>
was crucified: Mercifully grant that we, walking in the way<br/>
of the cross, may find it none other than the way of life and<br/>
peace; through Jesus Christ our Lord. <em>Amen.</em></p>

in his resurrection; through Jesus Christ our Lord, who lives<br/>
and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever<br/>
and ever. <em>Amen</em>.</p>
