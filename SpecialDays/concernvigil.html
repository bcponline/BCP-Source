<h2 class="concern">Concerning the Vigil</h2>

<br/>
<p class="small">The Great Vigil, when observed, is the first service of Easter Day. It is <br/>
celebrated at a convenient time between sunset on Holy Saturday and<br/>
sunrise on Easter Morning.</p>

<p class="small">The service normally consists of four parts:</p>

<p class="small">1. The Service of Light.<br/>
2. The Service of Lessons.<br/>
3. Christian Initiation, or the Renewal of Baptismal Vows.<br/>
4. The Holy Eucharist with the administration of Easter Communion.</p>

<p class="small">It is customary for all the ordained ministers present, together with lay<br/>
readers, singers, and other persons, to take active parts in the service.</p>

<p class="small">The bishop, when present, is the chief celebrant, presides at Baptism<br/>
and administers Communion, and normally preaches the sermon.</p>

<p class="small">*The priests who are present share among them the reading of the Collects <br/>
which follow each Lesson, and assist at Baptism and the Eucharist. In the <br/>
absence of a bishop, a priest presides at the service.</p>

<p class="small">It is the prerogative of a deacon to carry the Paschal Candle to its place, <br/>
and to chant the Exsultet. Deacons likewise assist at Baptism and the <br/>
Eucharist according to their order.</p>

<p class="small">Lay persons read the Lessons and the Epistle, and assist in other ways. A <br/>
lay person may be assigned to chant the Exsultet. It is desirable that each <br/>
Lesson be read by a different reader.</p>

<p class="small">In the absence of a bishop or priest, a deacon or lay reader may lead the <br/>
first two parts of the service, the Renewal of Baptismal Vows, and the <br/>
Ministry of the Word of the Vigil Eucharist, concluding with the Prayers <br/>
of the People, the Lord's Prayer, and the Dismissal.</p>

<p class="small">A deacon may also, when the services of a priest cannot be obtained, and <br/>
with the authorization of the bishop, officiate at public Baptism; and may <br/>
administer Easter Communion from the Sacrament previously consecrated.</p>

<p class="small">When the Vigil is not celebrated, the Service of Light may take place at a <br/>
convenient time before the Liturgy on Easter Day.</p>
