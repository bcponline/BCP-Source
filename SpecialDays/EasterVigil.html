<h3 id="candle">The Lighting of the Paschal Candle</a></h3>

<p class="rubric">In the darkness, fire is kindled; after which the Celebrant may address the <br/>
people in these or similar words</p>

<p>Dear friends in Christ: On this most holy night, in which our<br/>
Lord Jesus passed over from death to life, the Church invites<br/>
her members, dispersed throughout the world, to gather in<br/>
vigil and prayer. For this is the Passover of the Lord, in which,<br/>
by hearing his Word and celebrating his Sacraments, we share<br/>
in his victory over death.</p>

<p class="rubric">The Celebrant may say the following prayer</p>

<p>Let us pray.</p>

<p>O God, through your Son you have bestowed upon your<br/>
people the brightness of your light: Sanctify this new fire, and<br/>
grant that in this Paschal feast we may so burn with heavenly<br/>
desires, that with pure minds we may attain to the festival of<br/>
everlasting light; through Jesus Christ our Lord. <em>Amen.</em></p>

<p class="rubric">The Paschal Candle is then lighted from the newly kindled fire, and the<br/>
Deacon (the Celebrant if there is no deacon) bearing the Candle, leads the <br/>
procession to the chancel, pausing three times and singing or saying</p>

and let your trumpets shout Salvation <br/>
for the victory of our mighty King. </p>

<p>Rejoice and sing now, all the round earth, <br/>
bright with a glorious splendor, <br/>
for darkness has been vanquished by our eternal King. </p>

and let your holy courts, in radiant light, <br/>
resound with the praises of your people. </p>

<p>whole heart and mind and voice, to praise you, the invisible,<br/>
almighty, and eternal God, and your only-begotten Son,<br/>
Jesus Christ our Lord; for he is the true Paschal Lamb, who<br/>
at the feast of the Passover paid for us the debt of Adam's sin,<br/>
and by his blood delivered your faithful people.</p>

<p>This is the night, when you brought our fathers, the children<br/>
of Israel, out of bondage in Egypt, and led them through the<br/>
Red Sea on dry land.</p>

<p>This is the night, when all who believe in Christ are delivered<br/>
from the gloom of sin, and are restored to grace and holiness<br/>
of life.</p>

<p>This is the night, when Christ broke the bonds of death and hell, <br/>
and rose victorious from the grave.</p>

<p style="border-left: 2px solid">&nbsp;&nbsp; How wonderful and beyond our knowing, O God, is your<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; mercy and loving-kindness to us, that to redeem a slave, you<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; gave a Son.</p>

<p style="border-left: 2px solid">&nbsp;&nbsp; How holy is this night, when wickedness is put to flight, and<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; sin is washed away. It restores innocence to the fallen, and joy<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; to those who mourn. It casts out pride and hatred, and brings<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; peace and concord.</p>

<p style="border-left: 2px solid">&nbsp;&nbsp; How blessed is this night, when earth and heaven are joined<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; and man is reconciled to God.</p>

<p>Holy Father, accept our evening sacrifice, the offering of this<br/>
candle in your honor. May it shine continually to drive away<br/>
all darkness. May Christ, the Morning Star who knows no<br/>
setting, find it ever burning--he who gives his light to all<br/>
creation, and who lives and reigns for ever and ever. <em>Amen.</em></p>
