<title>Concerning the Celebration:&nbsp; Holy Eucharist</title>

<h2 class="concern">Concerning the Lectionary</h2>

<br/>
<p class="small">The Lectionary for Sundays is arranged in a three-year cycle, in which<br/>
Year A always begins on the First Sunday of Advent in years evenly <br/>
divisible by three. (For example, 1977 divided by 3 is 659 with no <br/>
remainder. Year A, therefore, begins on Advent Sunday of that year.)</p>

<p class="small">The Psalms and Lessons appointed for the Sundays and for other major <br/>
Holy Days are intended for use at all public services on such days, except <br/>
when the same congregation attends two or more services. Thus, the <br/>
same Lessons are to be read at the principal morning service, whether the <br/>
Liturgy of the Word takes the form given in the Holy Eucharist, or that of <br/>
the Daily Office.</p>

<p class="small">When the same congregation is present for Morning or Evening Prayer, <br/>
in addition to the Eucharist, the Lessons at the Office may be selected <br/>
from one of the other years of the three-year Sunday cycle, or from the <br/>
Lectionary for the Daily Office. The Psalms at such Offices are normally <br/>
those appointed in the Office Lectionary; but, when desired, the Psalm <br/>
cited in the selected Sunday Proper may be used instead.</p>

<p class="small">In this Lectionary, the selections from the Psalter are frequently cited in a<br/>
longer and shorter version, usually from the same Psalm. The longer <br/>
version is particularly appropriate for use at the Office, the shorter version<br/>
when the Psalm is sung between the Lessons at the Eucharist. The selections <br/>
may be further lengthened or shortened at discretion.</p>

<p class="small">When an alternative Lesson is cited, it is sometimes identical with a <br/>
Lesson appointed for the same day in the Daily Office Lectionary.</p>

<p class="small">In the opening verses of Lessons, the Reader should omit initial <br/>
conjunctions which refer only to what has preceded, substitute nouns for <br/>
pronouns when the referent is not otherwise clear, or else prefix to the <br/>
Reading some such introduction as, &quot;N. said (to N.).&quot;</p>

<p class="small">Any Reading may be lengthened at discretion. Suggested lengthenings are <br/>
shown in parentheses.</p>
