<strong>About the Revised Common Lectionary</strong><br/>
A lectionary is a table of readings from Scripture appointed to be read at public worship. The Lectionary (1969, revised 1981) <br/>
developed by the Roman Catholic Church after Vatican II provided for a three-year cycle of Sunday readings. This Roman lectionary <br/>
provided the basis for the lectionary in 1979 edition of The Book of Common Prayer, as well as for lectionaries developed by <br/>
many other denominations.<br/>
<br/>
The Common Lectionary, published in 1983, was an ecumenical project of several American and Canadian denominations, developed <br/>
out of a concern for the unity of the church and a desire for a common experience of Scripture. It was intended as a harmonization <br/>
of the many different denominational approaches to the three-year lectionary.<br/>
<br/>
The Revised Common Lectionary, published in 1992 and officially adopted by The Episcopal Church in 2006, takes into account <br/>
constructive criticism of the Common Lectionary based on the evaluation of its trial use, and like the current prayer-book <br/>
lectionary, is a three-year cycle of Sunday Eucharistic readings in which Matthew, Mark, and Luke are read in successive years <br/>
with some material from John read in each year.</p>
