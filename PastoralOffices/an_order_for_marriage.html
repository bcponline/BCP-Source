<h1>An Order for Marriage</h1>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<p class="rubric">If it is desired to celebrate a marriage otherwise than as provided on <a href="marriage.html">page<br/>
423</a> of this Book, this Order is used.<br/>
<br/>
Normally, the celebrant is a priest or bishop. Where permitted by civil<br/>
law, and when no priest or bishop is available, a deacon may function as<br/>
celebrant, but does not pronounce a nuptial blessing.<br/>
<br/>
The laws of the State and the canons of this Church having been<br/>
complied with, the man and the woman, together with their witnesses,<br/>
families, and friends assemble in the church or in some other convenient<br/>
place.<br/>
<br/>
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;The teaching of the Church concerning Holy Matrimony, as it is<br/>
declared in the formularies and canons of this Church, is briefly stated.<br/>
<br/>
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;The intention of the man and the woman to enter the state of<br/>
matrimony, and their free consent, is publicly ascertained.<br/>
<br/>
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;One or more Readings, one of which is always from Holy Scripture,<br/>
may precede the exchange of vows.&nbsp; If there is to be a Communion,<br/>
a Reading from the Gospel is always included.<br/>
<br/>
4.&nbsp;&nbsp;The vows of the man and woman are exchanged, using the following<br/>
form</p>
 
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>

<p>In the Name of God, I, <em>N.</em>, take you, <em>N.</em>, to be my<br/>
(wife) (husband), to have and to hold from this day forward,<br/>
for better for worse, for richer for poorer, in sickness and in<br/>
health, to love and to cherish, until we are parted by death.<br/>
This is my solemn vow.</p>

<p class="rubric">or this</p>

<p>I, <em>N.</em>, take thee, <em>N.</em>, to my wedded (wife) (husband), to have<br/>
and to hold from this day forward, for better for worse, for<br/>
richer for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love and to<br/>
cherish, till death do us part, according to God's holy<br/>
ordinance; and thereto I (plight) (give) thee my troth.</p>

<p class="rubric">5.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Celebrant declares the union of the man and woman as husband<br/>
and wife, in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy<br/>
Spirit.<br/>
<br/>
6.&nbsp;&nbsp;Prayers are offered for the husband and wife, for their life together, for<br/>
the Christian community, and for the world.<br/>
<br/>
7.&nbsp;&nbsp;A priest or bishop pronounces a solemn blessing upon the couple.<br/>
<br/>
8.&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is no Communion, the service concludes with the Peace, the<br/>
husband and wife first greeting each other.&nbsp; The Peace may be exchanged<br/>
throughout the assembly.<br/>
<br/>
9.&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is to be a Communion, the service continues with the Peace and<br/>
the Offertory. The Holy Eucharist may be celebrated either according to<br/>
<a href="../HE/he1.html">Rite One</a> or <a href="../HE/he2.html">Rite Two</a> in this Book, or according to the Order on <a href="../HE/ordhe.html">page 401</a>.</p>
