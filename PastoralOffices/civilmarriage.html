<h1>The Blessing<br/>
of a Civil Marriage</h1>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<p class="rubric">The Rite begins as prescribed for celebrations of the Holy Eucharist,<br/>
using the Collect and Lessons appointed in the Marriage service.<br/>
<br/>
After the Gospel (and homily), the husband and wife stand before the<br/>
Celebrant, who addresses them in these or similar words</p>

<p><em>N.</em> and <em>N.</em>, you have come here today to seek the blessing of<br/>
God and of his Church upon your marriage. I require,<br/>
therefore, that you promise, with the help of God, to fulfill<br/>
the obligations which Christian Marriage demands.</p>

<p class="rubric">The Celebrant then addresses the husband, saying</p>

<p><em>N.</em>, you have taken <em>N.</em> to be your wife. Do you promise to<br/>
love her, comfort her, honor and keep her, in sickness and in<br/>
health; and, forsaking all others, to be faithful to her as long<br/>
as you both shall live?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="rubric">The Husband answers</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do.</p>

<p class="rubric">The Celebrant then addresses the wife, saying</p>

<p><em>N.</em>, you have taken <em>N.</em> to be your husband.&nbsp; Do you promise<br/>
to love him, comfort him, honor and keep him, in sickness<br/>
and in health; and, forsaking all others, to be faithful to him<br/>
as long as you both shall live?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="rubric">The Wife answers</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do.</p>

<br/>
<br/>

<p class="rubric">The Celebrant then addresses the congregation, saying</p>

<p>Will you who have witnessed these promises do all in your<br/>
power to uphold these two persons in their marriage?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="rubric">People</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will.</p>

<p class="rubric">If a ring or rings are to be blessed, the wife extends her hand (and the<br/>
husband extends his hand) toward the Priest, who says</p>

<p>Bless, O Lord, this ring to be a sign of the vows by which<br/>
this man and this woman have bound themselves to each<br/>
other; through Jesus Christ our Lord.&nbsp; Amen.</p>

<p class="rubric">The Celebrant joins the right hands of the husband and wife and says</p>

<p>Those whom God has joined together let no one put asunder.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="rubric">The Congregation responds</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amen.</p>

<p class="rubric">The service continues with The Prayers on <a href="marriage.html#Prayers">page 428</a>.</p>
