</font></i>I am Resurrection and I am Life, says the Lord.<br>
Whoever has faith in me shall have life,<br>
even though he die.<br>
And everyone who has life,<br>
and has committed himself to me in faith,<br>
shall not die for ever.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
As for me, I know that my Redeemer lives<br>
and that at the last he will stand upon the earth. <br>
After my awaking, he will raise me up;<br>
and in my body I shall see God.<br>
I myself shall see, and my eyes behold him<br>
who is my friend and not a stranger.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
For none of us has life in himself,<br>
and none becomes his own master when he dies. <br>
For if we have life, we are alive in the Lord, <br>
and if we die, we die in the Lord.<br>
So, then, whether we live or die,<br>
we are the Lord's possession.</font></p>

The God of peace, who brought again from the dead our <br>
Lord Jesus Christ, the great Shepherd of the sheep, through <br>
the blood of the eternal covenant: Make you perfect in <br>
every good work to do his will, working in you that which is <br>
well-pleasing in his sight; through Jesus Christ, to whom be <br>
glory for ever and ever. <i>Amen.</i><br>

your Son Jesus Christ our Lord. <i>Amen.</i><br>

Almighty God, with whom still live the spirits of those who <br>
die in the Lord, and with whom the souls of the faithful are in <br>
joy and felicity: We give you heartfelt thanks for the good <br>
examples of all your servants, who, having finished their <br>
course in faith, now find rest and refreshment. May we, with <br>
all who have died in the true faith of your holy Name, have <br>
perfect fulfillment and bliss in your eternal and everlasting <br>
glory; through Jesus Christ our Lord. <i>Amen.</i><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>O God, whose days are without end, and whose mercies <br>
cannot be numbered: Make us, we pray, deeply aware of the <br>
shortness and uncertainty of human life; and let your Holy <br>
Spirit lead us in holiness and righteousness all our days; that, <br>
when we shall have served you in our generation, we may be <br>
gathered to our ancestors, having the testimony of a good <br>
conscience, in the communion of the Catholic Church, in the <br>
confidence of a certain faith, in the comfort of a religious and <br>
holy hope, in favor with you, our God, and in perfect charity <br>
with the world. All this we ask through Jesus Christ<br>
our Lord. <i>Amen.</i><br>
&nbsp;<br>
<a name="O God, the King of Saints"></a>O God, the King of saints, we praise and glorify your holy <br>
Name for all your servants who have finished their course in <br>
your faith and fear: for the blessed Virgin Mary; for the holy <br>
patriarchs, prophets, apostles, and martyrs; and for all your <br>
other righteous servants, known to us and unknown; and we <br>
pray that, encouraged by their examples, aided by their <br>
prayers, and strengthened by their fellowship, we also may <br>
be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light; through <br>
the merits of your Son Jesus Christ our Lord. <i>Amen.</i><br>
&nbsp;<br>
Lord Jesus Christ, by your death you took away the sting of <br>
death: Grant to us your servants so to follow in faith where <br>
you have led the way, that we may at length fall asleep <br>
peacefully in you and wake up in your likeness; for your <br>
tender mercies' sake. <i>Amen.</i><br>
&nbsp;<br>
Father of all, we pray to you for those we love, but see no <br>
longer: Grant them your peace; let light perpetual shine upon <br>
them; and, in your loving wisdom and almighty power, work <br>
in them the good purpose of your perfect will; through Jesus <br>
Christ our Lord. <i>Amen.</i><p>&nbsp;</p>

Merciful God, Father of our Lord Jesus Christ who is the <br>
Resurrection and the Life: Raise us, we humbly pray, from <br>
the death of sin to the life of righteousness; that when we <br>
depart this life we may rest in him, and at the resurrection <br>
receive that blessing which your well-beloved Son shall then <br>
pronounce: &quot;Come, you blessed of my Father, receive the <br>
kingdom prepared for you from the beginning of the world.&quot; <br>
Grant this, O merciful Father, through Jesus Christ, our <br>
Mediator and Redeemer. <i>Amen.</i><br>
&nbsp;<br>
Grant, O Lord, to all who are bereaved the spirit of faith and <br>
courage, that they may have strength to meet the days to <br>
come with steadfastness and patience; not sorrowing as those <br>
without hope, but in thankful remembrance of your great <br>
goodness, and in the joyful expectation of eternal life with <br>
those they love. And this we ask in the Name of Jesus Christ <br>
our Savior. <i>Amen.</i><br>
&nbsp;<br>
Almighty God, Father of mercies and giver of comfort: Deal <br>
graciously, we pray, with all who mourn; that, casting all <br>
their care on you, they may know the consolation of your <br>
love; through Jesus Christ our Lord. <i>Amen.</i><p>&nbsp;</p>
