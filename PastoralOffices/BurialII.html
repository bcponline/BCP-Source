Rite Two</h1>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<p class="rubric">All stand while one or more of the following anthems are sung or said. <br/>
A hymn, psalm, or some other suitable anthem may be sung instead.</p>

<p id="anthems">
I am Resurrection and I am Life, says the Lord.<br/>
Whoever has faith in me shall have life,<br/>
even though he die.<br/>
And everyone who has life,<br/>
and has committed himself to me in faith,<br/>
shall not die for ever.</p>

<p>As for me, I know that my Redeemer lives<br/>
and that at the last he will stand upon the earth. <br/>
After my awaking, he will raise me up;<br/>
and in my body I shall see God.<br/>
I myself shall see, and my eyes behold him<br/>
who is my friend and not a stranger.</p>

<p>For none of us has life in himself,<br/>
and none becomes his own master when he dies. <br/>
For if we have life, we are alive in the Lord, <br/>
and if we die, we die in the Lord.<br/>
So, then, whether we live or die,<br/>
we are the Lord's possession.</p>

for they rest from their labors.</p>

<p class="rubric">Or else this anthem</p>

<p>In the midst of life we are in death;<br/>
from whom can we seek help?<br/>
From you alone, O Lord,<br/>
who by our sins are justly angered.</p>

Holy and merciful Savior,<br/>

shut not your ears to our prayers,<br/>

our earthly pilgrimage. In your boundless compassion, <br/>
console us who mourn. Give us faith to see in death the gate <br/>

holy hope, in favor with you, our God, and in perfect charity <br/>
with the world. All this we ask through Jesus Christ<br/>
our Lord. <em>Amen.</em></p>

<p>O God, the King of saints, we praise and glorify your holy <br/>
Name for all your servants who have finished their course in <br/>
your faith and fear: for the blessed Virgin Mary; for the holy <br/>
patriarchs, prophets, apostles, and martyrs; and for all your <br/>
other righteous servants, known to us and unknown; and we <br/>
pray that, encouraged by their examples, aided by their <br/>
prayers, and strengthened by their fellowship, we also may <br/>
be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light; through <br/>
the merits of your Son Jesus Christ our Lord. <em>Amen.</em></p>

<p>Lord Jesus Christ, by your death you took away the sting of <br/>
death: Grant to us your servants so to follow in faith where <br/>
you have led the way, that we may at length fall asleep <br/>
peacefully in you and wake up in your likeness; for your <br/>
tender mercies' sake. <em>Amen.</em></p>

<p>Father of all, we pray to you for those we love, but see no <br/>
longer: Grant them your peace; let light perpetual shine upon <br/>
them; and, in your loving wisdom and almighty power, work <br/>
in them the good purpose of your perfect will; through Jesus <br/>
Christ our Lord. <em>Amen.</em></p>

<p>Merciful God, Father of our Lord Jesus Christ who is the <br/>
Resurrection and the Life: Raise us, we humbly pray, from <br/>
the death of sin to the life of righteousness; that when we <br/>
depart this life we may rest in him, and at the resurrection <br/>
receive that blessing which your well-beloved Son shall then <br/>
pronounce: &quot;Come, you blessed of my Father, receive the <br/>
kingdom prepared for you from the beginning of the world.&quot; <br/>
Grant this, O merciful Father, through Jesus Christ, our <br/>
Mediator and Redeemer. <em>Amen.</em></p>

<p>Grant, O Lord, to all who are bereaved the spirit of faith and <br/>
courage, that they may have strength to meet the days to <br/>
come with steadfastness and patience; not sorrowing as those <br/>
without hope, but in thankful remembrance of your great <br/>
goodness, and in the joyful expectation of eternal life with <br/>
those they love. And this we ask in the Name of Jesus Christ <br/>
our Savior. <em>Amen.</em></p>

<p>Almighty God, Father of mercies and giver of comfort: Deal <br/>
graciously, we pray, with all who mourn; that, casting all <br/>
their care on you, they may know the consolation of your <br/>
love; through Jesus Christ our Lord. <em>Amen.</em><p>&nbsp;</p>
