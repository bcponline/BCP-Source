<p>I am the resurrection and the life, saith the Lord;<br/>
he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live;<br/>
and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die.<br/>
<br/>
I know that my Redeemer liveth,<br/>

and though this body be destroyed, yet shall I see God;<br/>
whom I shall see for myself and mine eyes shall behold,<br/>

Whether we live, therefore, or die, we are the Lord's.<br/>

Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord;<br/>
