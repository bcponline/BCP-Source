<h1>A Thanksgiving for the Birth <br/>
or Adoption of a Child</h1><br/>
<br/>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="rubric">As soon as convenient after the birth of a child, or after receiving a child <br/>
by adoption, the parents, with other members of the family, should come <br/>
to the church to be welcomed by the congregation and to give thanks to <br/>
Almighty God.  It is desirable that this take place at a Sunday service.  In <br/>
the Eucharist it may follow the Prayers of the People preceding the <br/>
Offertory.  At Morning or Evening Prayer it may take place before the <br/>
close of the Office.</p>

<p class="rubric">When desired, a briefer form of this service may be used, especially in the <br/>
hospital or at home; in which case the Celebrant may begin with the Act <br/>
of Thanksgiving, or with the prayer &quot;O God, you have taught is.&quot  A<br/> 
passage from Scripture may first be read.  Either Luke 2:41-51, or Luke <br/>
18:15-17, is appropriate.</p>

<p class="rubric">During the prayers, some parents may wish to express thanks in their <br/>
own words.</p>

<p class="rubric">At the proper time, the Celebrant invites the parents and other members <br/>
of the family to present themselves before the Altar.</p>

<h3>For the Birth of a Child</h3>

<p class="rubric">The Celebrant addresses the congregation in these or similar words</p>

<p>Dear Friends:  The birth of a child is a joyous and solemn <br/>
occasion in the life of a family.  It is also an occasion for <br/>
rejoicing in the Christian community.  I bid you, therefore, <br/>
to join <em>N.</em> [and <em>N.</em>] in giving thanks to Almighty God our <br/>
heavenly Father, the Lord of all life, for the gift of <em>N.</em> to be <br/>
their son (daughter) [and with <em>N.</em> (and <em>N.N.</em>), for a new <br/>
brother (sister)].  Let us say together:</p>

<p class="rubric">The service continues with the <a href="#Magnificat">Magnificat</a> or one of the Psalms on <br/>
<a href="#Psalms">pages 441-443</a>.</p>

<p>
<h3For an Adoption</h3>

<p class="rubric">The Celebrant addresses the congregation in these or similar words</p>

<p>Dear Friends:  It has pleased God our heavenly Father to <br/>
answer the earnest prayers of <em>N.</em> [and <em>N.</em>], member(s) of this <br/>
Christian family, for the gift of a child.  I bid you join with <br/>
<em>them</em> [and with <em>N.</em> (and <em>N.N.</em>), who now <em>has</em> a new brother <br/>
(sister)] in offering heartfelt thanks for the joyful and solemn <br/>
responsibility which is <em>theirs</em> by the coming of <em>N.</em> to be a <br/>
member of <em>their</em> family.  But first, our friends wish us, here <br/>
assembled, to witness the inauguration of this new <br/>
relationship.</p>

<p class="rubric">The Celebrant asks the parent or parents</p>

<p>
<table class="vrtable">
	<tr>
		<td class="rubric"></td>
		<td><em>N.</em> [and <em>N.</em>], do you take this child for your own?</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="rubric">Parent(s)</td>
		<td>I do.</td>
	</tr>
</table>
</p>


<br/>
<br/>
<p class="leftfoot">440&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Thanksgiving for a Child</em></p>
<hr>
<br/>
<br/>


<p class="rubric">Then if the child is old enough to answer, the Celebrant asks</p>

<p>
<table class="vrtable">
	<tr>
		<td class="rubric"></td>
		<td><em>N.</em>, do you take this woman as your mother?</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="rubric">Child</td>
		<td>I do.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td></td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="rubric">Celebrant</td>
		<td><em>N.</em>, do you take this man as your father?</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="rubric">Child</td>
		<td>I do.</td>
	</tr>

</table>
</p>

<p class="rubric">Then the Celebrant, holding or taking the child by the hand, gives the <br/>
child to the mother or father, saying</p>

<p>As God has made us his children by adoption and grace, may <br/>
you receive <em>N.</em> as your own son (daughter).</p>

<p class="rubric">Then one or both parents say these or similar words</p>

<p>May God, the Father of all, bless our child <em>N.</em>, and us who <br/>
have given to <em>him</em> our family name, that we may live together <br/>
in love and affection; through Jesus Christ our Lord.  <em>Amen.</em></p>

<p class="rubric">The Celebrant says</p>
<p>Since it has pleased God to bestow upon <em>N.</em> [and <em>N.</em>] the gift <br/>
of a child, let us now give thanks to him, and say together:<br/>
<br/>
</p>


<h3>Act of Thanksgiving</h3>

<p id="Magnificat"><em>The Song of Mary</em></p>

<p>My soul proclaims the greatness of the Lord,<br/>
my spirit rejoices in God my Savior; *<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for he has looked with favor on his lowly servant.<br/>
From this day all generations will call me blessed:  *<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Almighty has done great things for me,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and holy is his Name.<br/>
He has mercy on those who fear him *<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in every generation.</p>

<p>He has shown the strength of his arm, *<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he has scattered the proud in their conceit.<br/>
He has cast down the mighty from their thrones,  *<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and has lifted up the lowly.<br/>
He has filled the hungry with good things, *<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the rich he has sent away empty.<br/>
He has come to the help of his servant Israel,  *<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for he has remembered his promise of mercy,<br/>
The promise he made to our fathers, *<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to Abraham and his children for ever.<br/>
Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever.  Amen.</p>

<p class="rubric">or this</p>

<p id="Psalms"><em>Psalm 116</em></p>

<p>I love the LORD, because he has heard the voice of my <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;supplication, *<br/>
because he has inclined his ear to me whenever I called <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;upon him.<br/>
Gracious is the LORD and righteous; *<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;our God is full of compassion.<br/>
How shall I repay the LORD *<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for all the good things he has done for me?<br/>
I will lift up the cup of salvation *<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and call upon the Name of the LORD.<br/>
I will fulfill my vows to the LORD *<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the presence of all his people.<br/>
In the courts of the LORD'S house, *<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the midst of you, O Jerusalem.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hallelujah!<br/>
Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever.  Amen.</p>

<p class="rubric">or this</p>

<p><em>Psalm 23</em></p>

<p>The LORD is my shepherd; *<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall not be in want.<br/>
He makes me lie down in green pastures *<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and leads me beside still waters.<br/>
He revives my soul *<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and guides me along right pathways for his Name's sake.<br/>
Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,<br/>
I shall fear no evil; *<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for you are with me;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your rod and your staff, they comfort me.<br/>
You spread a table before me in the presence of those</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who trouble me; *<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you have anointed my head with oil,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and my cup is running over.<br/>
Surely your goodness and mercy shall follow me all the <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;days of my life, *<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
and I will dwell in the house of the LORD for ever.<br/>
Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever.  Amen.</p>

<p class="rubric">The Celebrant then says this prayer</p>

<p>Let us pray.</p>

<p>O God, you have taught us through your blessed Son that <br/>
whoever receives a little child in the name of Christ receives <br/>
Christ himself: We give thanks for the blessing you have <br/>
bestowed upon this family in giving them a child.  Confirm <br/>
their joy by a lively sense of your presence with them, and <br/>
give them calm strength and patient wisdom as they seek to <br/>
bring this child to love all that is true and noble, just and <br/>
pure, lovable and gracious, excellent and admirable, <br/>
following the example of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.<br/>
<em>Amen.</em></p>

<h3>Prayers</h3>

<p class="rubric">The Celebrant may add one or more of the following prayers</p>

<p id="delivery"><em>For a safe delivery</em></p>

<p>O gracious God, we give you humble and hearty thanks that <br/>
you have preserved through the pain and anxiety of child-<br/>
birth your servant <em>N.</em>, who desires now to offer you her praises <br/>
and thanksgivings.  Grant, most merciful Father, that by your <br/>
help she may live faithfully according to your will in this life, <br/>

through Jesus Christ our Lord. <em>Amen.</em></p>

<p>Almighty God, giver of life and love, bless <em>N.</em> and <em>N.</em>  Grant <br/>
them wisdom and devotion in the ordering of their common <br/>
life, that each may be to the other a strength in need, a <br/>
counselor in perplexity, a comfort in sorrow, and a companion <br/>
in joy.  And so knit their wills together in your will and their <br/>
spirits in your Spirit, that they may live together in love and <br/>
peace all the days of their life; through Jesus Christ our Lord.  <br/>
<em>Amen.</em></p>

<p><em>For a child not yet baptized</em></p>

<p>O eternal God, you have promised to be a father to a <br/>
thousand generations of those who love and fear you: Bless <br/>
this child and preserve <em>his</em> life; receive <em>him</em> and enable <em>him</em> to <br/>
receive you, that through the Sacrament of Baptism <em>he</em> may <br/>
become the child of God; through Jesus Christ our Lord.  <br/>
<em>Amen.</em></p>

<p>Into your hands, O God, we place your child <em>N.</em>  Support <em>him</em><br/>

<p>sorrows.  As <em>he</em> grows in age, may <em>he</em> grow in grace, and in <br/>
the knowledge of <em>his</em> Savior Jesus Christ.  <em>Amen.</em></p>

<p class="rubric">The Celebrant may then bless the family</p>

<p>May God the Father, who by Baptism adopts us as his <br/>
children, grant you grace.  <em>Amen.</em></p>

<p>May God the Son, who sanctified a home at Nazareth, fill <br/>
you with love.  <em>Amen.</em></p>

family, keep you in peace.  <em>Amen.</em></p>

<p class="rubric">The Peace may be exchanged.</p>

<p class="rubric">The Minister of the Congregation is directed to instruct the people, from <br/>
time to time, about the duty of Christian parents to make prudent <br/>
provision for the well-being of their families, and of all persons to make <br/>
wills, while they are in health, arranging for the disposal of their <br/>
temporal goods, not neglecting, if they are able, to leave bequests for <br/>
religious and charitable uses.</p>
