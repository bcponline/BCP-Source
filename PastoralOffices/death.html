<p><em>A Commendatory Prayer</em><br/>
<br/>
Into your hands, O merciful Savior, we commend your <br/>
servant <em>N.</em> Acknowledge, we humbly beseech you, a sheep of <br/>
your own fold, a lamb of your own flock, a sinner of your <br/>
own redeeming. Receive <em>him</em> into the arms of your mercy, <br/>
into the blessed rest of everlasting peace, and into the <br/>
glorious company of the saints in light. <em>Amen.</em><br/>
<br/>
May <em>his</em> soul and the souls of all the departed, through the <br/>
mercy of God, rest in peace. <em>Amen.</em></p>

<h4><a name="Vigil"></a>Prayers for a Vigil</h4>

<p class="rubric">It is appropriate that the family and friends come together for prayers <br/>
prior to the funeral. Suitable Psalms, Lessons, and Collects (such as those <br/>
in the <a href="BurialII.html">Burial service</a>) may be used. The Litany at the Time of Death may <br/>
be said, or the following</p>

Dear Friends: It was our Lord Jesus himself who said, <br/>
&quot;Come to me, all you who labor and are burdened, and I will <br/>
give you rest.&quot; Let us pray, then, for our brother (sister) <em>N.</em>, <br/>
that <em>he</em> may rest from <em>his</em> labors, and enter into the light <br/>
of God's eternal sabbath rest.<br/>
<br/>
Receive, O Lord, your servant, for <em>he</em> returns to you.<br/>
<em>Into your hands, O Lord, <br/>
we commend our brother (sister)  N.</em><br/>
<br/>
Wash <em>him</em> in the holy font of everlasting life, and clothe <br/>
<em>him</em> in <em>his</em> heavenly wedding garment.<br/>
<em>Into your hands, O Lord, <br/>
we commend our brother (sister)  N.</em><br/>
<br/>
May <em>he</em> hear your words of invitation, &quot;Come, you blessed of <br/>
my Father.&quot;<br/>
<em>Into your hands, O Lord, <br/>
we commend our brother (sister)  N.</em></p>

<p>May <em>he</em> gaze upon you, Lord, face to face, and taste the <br/>
blessedness of perfect rest.<br/>
<em>Into your hands, O Lord, <br/>
we commend our brother (sister)  N.</em><br/>
<br/>
May angels surround <em>him</em>, and saints welcome <em>him</em> in peace.<br/>
<em>Into your hands, O Lord, <br/>
we commend our brother (sister)  N.</em></p>

<p class="rubric">The Officiant concludes</p>

<p>Almighty God, our Father in heaven, before whom live all <br/>
who die in the Lord: Receive our <em>brother  N.</em> into the courts of <br/>
your heavenly dwelling place. Let <em>his</em> heart and soul now ring <br/>
out in joy to you, O Lord, the living God, and the God of <br/>
those who live. This we ask through Christ our Lord. <em>Amen.</em></p>
<br/>

<h4>Reception of the Body</h4>

<p class="rubric">The following form may be used at whatever time the body is brought to <br/>
the church.<br/>
<br/>
The Celebrant meets the body at the door of the church and says</p>

<p>With faith in Jesus Christ, we receive the body of our brother <br/>
(sister) <em>N.</em> for burial. Let us pray with confidence to God, the <br/>
Giver of life, that he will raise <em>him</em> to perfection in the <br/>
company of the saints.<br/>
<br/>
<em>Silence may be kept; after which the Celebrant says<br/>
<br/>
</em>Deliver your servant, <em>N.</em>, O Sovereign Lord Christ, from all <br/>
evil, and set <em>him</em> free from every bond; that <em>he</em> may rest with <br/>
all your saints in the eternal habitations; where with the <br/>
Father and the Holy Spirit you live and reign, one God, for <br/>
ever and ever. <em>Amen.</em></p>

<br/>
<br/>
<p class="leftfoot">466&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>At Time of Death</em></p>

<br/>
<br/>

<p>Let us also pray for all who mourn, that they may cast their <br/>
care on God, and know the consolation of his love.</p>

<p class="rubric">Silence may be kept; after which the Celebrant says</p>

<p>Almighty God, look with pity upon the sorrows of your <br/>
servants for whom we pray. Remember them, Lord, in your mercy; <br/>
nourish them with patience; comfort them with a sense of your <br/>
goodness; lift up your countenance upon them; and give them <br/>
peace; through Jesus Christ our Lord. <em>Amen.</em></p>

<p class="rubric">If the Burial service is not to follow immediately, the body is then <br/>
brought into the church, during which time a suitable psalm or anthem <br/>
may be sung or said. Appropriate devotions, such as those appointed for <br/>
the Vigil on <a href="#Vigil">page 465</a>, may follow.<br/>
<br/>
When the order for the Burial of the Dead follows immediately, the <br/>
service continues on page <a href="BurialI.html">469</a> or 
<a href="BurialII.html">491</a>.<br/>
<br/>
A member of the congregation bearing the lighted Paschal Candle may <br/>
lead the procession into the church.</p>
