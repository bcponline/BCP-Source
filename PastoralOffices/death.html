The Celebrant meets the body at the door of the church and says<br>

nourish them with patience; comfort them with a sense of your <br>

peace; through Jesus Christ our Lord. <i>Amen.</i><br>

If the Burial service is not to follow immediately, the body is then <br>
brought into the church, during which time a suitable psalm or anthem <br>
may be sung or said. Appropriate devotions, such as those appointed for <br>
the Vigil on <a href="#Vigil">page 465</a>, may follow.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
When the order for the Burial of the Dead follows immediately, the <br>
service continues on page <a href="BurialI.html">469</a> or 
<a href="BurialII.html">491</a>.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
A member of the congregation bearing the lighted Paschal Candle may <br>
lead the procession into the church.<br>
