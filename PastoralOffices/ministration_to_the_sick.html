<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<p class="rubric">In case of illness, the Minister of the Congregation is to be notified.<br/>
<br/>
At the ministration, one or more parts of the following service are used,<br/>
as appropriate, but when two or more are used together, they are used in<br/>
the order indicated. The Lord's Prayer is always included.<br/>
<br/>
Part One of this service may always be led by a deacon or lay person.<br/>
<br/>
When the Laying on of Hands or Anointing takes place at a public<br/>
celebration of the Eucharist, it is desirable that it precede the distribution of<br/>
Holy Communion, and it is recommended that it take place immediately<br/>
before the exchange of the Peace.<br/>
<br/>
The Celebrant begins the service with the following or some other greeting</p>

<p>Peace be to this house (place), and to all who dwell in it.</p>

<h4>Part I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ministry of the Word</h4>

<p class="rubric">One or more of the following or other passages of Scripture are read</p>

<p class="rubric">After any Reading, the Celebrant may comment on it briefly.<br/>
<br/>
Prayers may be offered according to the occasion.<br/>
<br/>
The Priest may suggest the making of a special confession, if the sick<br/>
person's conscience is troubled, and use the form for the Reconciliation<br/>
of a Penitent.<br/>
<br/>
Or else the following general confession may be said</p>

<p>Most merciful God,<br/>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br/>
in thought, word, and deed,<br/>
by what we have done,<br/>
and by what we have left undone.<br/>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br/>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br/>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.</p>

<br/>
<p class="leftfoot">454&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Ministration to the Sick</em></p>

<br/>
<br/>

<p>For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br/>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br/>
that we may delight in your will,<br/>
and walk in your ways,<br/>
to the glory of your Name. <em>Amen.</em></p>

<p class="rubric">The Priest alone says</p>

<p>Almighty God have mercy on you, forgive you all your sins<br/>
through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen you in all goodness,<br/>
and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep you in eternal life.<br/>
<em>Amen.</em></p>

<p class="rubric">A deacon or lay person using the preceding form substitutes &quot;us&quot; for<br/>
&quot;you&quot; and &quot;our&quot; for &quot;your.&quot;</p>

<h4>Part II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laying on of Hands and Anointing</h4>

<p style="border-left: 2px outset rgb(0,0,0); margin-left: 0px; padding-left: 15px">
<span class="rubric">If oil for the Anointing of the Sick is to be blessed, the Priest says</span><br/>
<br/>
O Lord, holy Father, giver of health and salvation: Send your<br/>
Holy Spirit to sanctify this oil; that, as your holy apostles<br/>
anointed many that were sick and healed them, so may those<br/>
who in faith and repentance receive this holy unction be<br/>
made whole; through Jesus Christ our Lord, who lives and<br/>
reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and<br/>
ever. <em>Amen.</em></p>

<p class="rubric">The following anthem is said</p>

<p>Savior of the world, by your cross and precious blood you<br/>
have redeemed us;<br/>
<em>Save us and help us, we humbly beseech you, O Lord.</em></p>

<p class="rubric">The Priest then lays hands upon the sick person, and says one of the<br/>
following</p>

<br/>
<br/>
<p class="rightfoot"><em>Ministration to the Sick</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;455</p>
<hr>
<br/>
<br/>

<p><em>N.</em>, I lay my hands upon you in the Name of the Father, and<br/>
of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, beseeching our Lord Jesus<br/>
Christ to sustain you with his presence, to drive away all<br/>
sickness of body and spirit, and to give you that victory of life<br/>
and peace which will enable you to serve him both now and<br/>
evermore. <em>Amen.</em></p>

<p class="rubric">or this</p>

<p><em>N.</em>, I lay my hands upon you in the Name of our Lord and<br/>
Savior Jesus Christ, beseeching him to uphold you and fill<br/>
you with his grace, that you may know the healing power of<br/>
his love. <em>Amen.</em></p>

<p class="rubric">If the person is to be anointed, the Priest dips a thumb in the holy oil,<br/>
and makes the sign of the cross on the sick person's forehead, saying</p>

<p><em>N.</em>, I anoint you with oil in the Name of the Father, and of<br/>
the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. <em>Amen.</em>

<p class="rubric">The Priest may add</p>

<p>As you are outwardly anointed with this holy oil, so may our<br/>
heavenly Father grant you the inward anointing of the Holy<br/>
Spirit.&nbsp; Of his great mercy, may he forgive you your sins,<br/>
release you from suffering, and restore you to wholeness and<br/>
strength.&nbsp; May he deliver you from all evil, preserve you in all<br/>
goodness, and bring you to everlasting life; through Jesus<br/>
Christ our Lord. <em>Amen.</em></p>

<p class="rubric">In cases of necessity, a deacon or lay person may perform the anointing,<br/>
using oil blessed by a bishop or priest.<br/>
<br/>
If Communion is not to follow, the Lord's Prayer is now said.<br/>
<br/>
The Priest concludes</p>

<p>The Almighty Lord, who is a strong tower to all who put their<br/>
trust in him, to whom all things in heaven, on earth, and under</p>

<br/>
<br/>
<p class="leftfoot">456&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Ministration to the Sick</em></p>

<br/>
<br/>

<p>the earth bow and obey: Be now and evermore your defense,<br/>
and make you know and feel that the only Name under<br/>
heaven given for health and salvation is the Name of our Lord<br/>
Jesus Christ. <em>Amen.</em></p>

<br/>

<h4>Part III.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Holy Communion</h4>

<p class="rubric">If the Eucharist is to be celebrated, the Priest begins with the [Peace and]<br/>
Offertory.<br/>
<br/>
If Communion is to be administered from the reserved Sacrament, the<br/>
form for Communion under Special Circumstances is used, beginning with<br/>
the [Peace and] <a href="../General/paternoster.html">Lord's Prayer</a> on page 398.<br/>
<br/>
If the sick person cannot receive either the consecrated Bread or the<br/>
Wine, it is suitable to administer the Sacrament in one kind only.<br/>
<br/>
One of the usual <a name="pcprayer">postcommunion prayers</a> is said, or the following</p>

<p>Gracious Father, we give you praise and thanks for this Holy<br/>
Communion of the Body and Blood of your beloved Son<br/>
Jesus Christ, the pledge of our redemption; and we pray that<br/>
it may bring us forgiveness of our sins, strength in our<br/>
weakness, and everlasting salvation; through Jesus Christ<br/>
our Lord. <em>Amen.</em></p>

<p class="rubric">The service concludes with a blessing or with a dismissal</p>

<p>Let us bless the Lord.<br/>
<em>Thanks be to God.</em></p>

<p class="rubric">If a person desires to receive the Sacrament, but, by reason of extreme<br/>
sickness or physical disability, is unable to eat and drink the Bread and<br/>
Wine, the Celebrant is to assure that person that all the benefits of<br/>
Communion are received, even though the Sacrament is not received<br/>
with the mouth.</p>

<h4>Prayers for use by a Sick Person</h4>

<p><em>For Trust in God</em><br/>
<br/>
O God, the source of all health: So fill my heart with faith in<br/>
your love, that with calm expectancy I may make room for<br/>
your power to possess me, and gracefully accept your<br/>
healing; through Jesus Christ our Lord. <em>Amen.</em><br/>
<br/>
<em>In Pain</em><br/>
<br/>
Lord Jesus Christ, by your patience in suffering you hallowed<br/>
earthly pain and gave us the example of obedience to your<br/>
Father's will: Be near me in my time of weakness and pain;<br/>
sustain me by your grace, that my strength and courage may<br/>
not fail; heal me according to your will; and help me always<br/>
to believe that what happens to me here is of little account if<br/>
you hold me in eternal life, my Lord and my God. <em>Amen.</em><br/>
<br/>
<em>For Sleep</em><br/>
<br/>
O heavenly Father, you give your children sleep for the<br/>
refreshing of soul and body: Grant me this gift, I pray; keep<br/>
me in that perfect peace which you have promised to those<br/>
whose minds are fixed on you; and give me such a sense of<br/>
your presence, that in the hours of silence I may enjoy the<br/>
blessed assurance of your love; through Jesus Christ our<br/>
Lord. <em>Amen.</em><br/>
<br/>
<em>In the Morning</em><br/>
<br/>
This is another day, O Lord. I know not what it will bring<br/>
forth, but make me ready, Lord, for whatever it may be. If I<br/>
am to stand up, help me to stand bravely. If I am to sit still,<br/>
help me to sit quietly. If I am to lie low, help me to do it<br/>
patiently. And if I am to do nothing, let me do it gallantly.<br/>
Make these words more than words, and give me the Spirit<br/>
of Jesus. <em>Amen.</em></p>
