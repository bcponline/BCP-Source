<p class="rubric">Then the Bishop says</p>

<p>Almighty God, we thank you that by the death and<br/>
resurrection of your Son Jesus Christ you have overcome sin<br/>
and brought us to yourself, and that by the sealing of your <br/>
Holy Spirit you have bound us to your service.&nbsp; Renew in <br/>
<em>these</em> your <em>servants</em> the covenant you have made with <em>them</em> at <em>their</em> <br/>
Baptism.&nbsp; Send <em>them</em> forth in the power of that Spirit to <br/>
perform the service you set before <em>them</em>; through Jesus Christ <br/>
your Son our Lord, who lives and reigns with you and the <br/>
Holy Spirit, one God, now and for ever.&nbsp; <em>Amen.</em><br/>

empower <em>him</em> for your service; and sustain <em>him</em> all the days <br/>

life. <em>Amen.</em></p>

<p class="rubric">or this</p>

<p>Defend, O Lord, your servant <em>N.</em> with your heavenly grace, <br/>
that <em>he</em> may continue yours for ever, and daily increase in <br/>
your Holy Spirit more and more, until <em>he</em> comes to your <br/>
everlasting
kingdom.&nbsp; <em>Amen.</em></p>

<h4>For Reception</h4>

<p><em>N.</em>, we recognize you as a member of the one holy catholic <br/>
and apostolic Church, and we receive you into the fellowship <br/>
of this Communion.&nbsp; God, the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, <br/>
bless, preserve, and keep you.&nbsp; <em>Amen.</em></p>

direct and uphold you in the service of Christ and his <br/>
kingdom.&nbsp; <em>Amen.</em></p>

<p class="rubric">The Bishop concludes with this prayer</p>

<p>Almighty and everliving God, let your fatherly hand ever be<br/>
over <em>these</em> your <em>servants</em>; let your Holy Spirit ever be with<br/>
<em>them</em>; and so lead <em>them</em> in the knowledge and obedience of<br/>
your Word, that <em>they</em> may serve you in this life, and dwell<br/>
with you in the life to come; through Jesus Christ our Lord.<br/>
<em>Amen.</em></p>
