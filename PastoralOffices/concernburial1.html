<h2 class="concern">Concerning the Service</h2>

<br/>
<p class="small">The death of a member of the Church should be reported as soon as<br/>
possible to, and arrangements for the funeral should be made in <br/>
consultation with, the Minister of the Congregation.</p>

<p class="small">Baptized Christians are properly buried from the church. The service <br/>
should be held at a time when the congregation has opportunity to be <br/>
present.</p>

<p class="small">The coffin is to be closed before the service, and it remains closed thereafter.<br/>
It is appropriate that it be covered with a pall or other suitable covering.</p>

<p class="small">If necessary, or if desired, all or part of the service of Committal may be <br/>
said in the church. If preferred, the Committal service may take place <br/>
before the service in the church. It may also be used prior to cremation.</p>

<p class="small">A priest normally presides at the service. It is appropriate that the bishop,<br/>
when present, preside at the Eucharist and pronounce the Commendation.</p>

<p class="small">It is desirable that the Lesson from the Old Testament, and the Epistle, be <br/>
read by lay persons.</p>

<p class="small">When the services of a priest cannot be obtained, a deacon or lay reader <br/>
may preside at the service.</p>

<p class="small">At the burial of a child, the passages from Lamentations, 1 John, and <br/>
John 6, together with Psalm 23, are recommended.</p>

<p class="small">It is customary that the celebrant meet the body and go before it into the <br/>
church or towards the grave.</p>

<p class="small">The anthems at the beginning of the service are sung or said as the body is <br/>
borne into the church, or during the entrance of the ministers, or by the <br/>
celebrant standing in the accustomed place.</p>
