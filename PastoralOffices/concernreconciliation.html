<title>Concerning the Rite:&nbsp; Reconciliation of a Penitent</title>
</head>

<body>


<h2 class="concern">Concerning the Rite</h2>

<br/>
<p class="small">The ministry of reconciliation, which has been committed by Christ to his<br/>
Church, is exercised through the care each Christian has for others,<br/>
through the common prayer of Christians assembled for public worship,<br/>
and through the priesthood of Christ and his ministers declaring<br/>
absolution.</p>

<p class="small">The Reconciliation of a Penitent is available for all who desire it. It is not<br/>
restricted to times of sickness. Confessions may be heard anytime and <br/>
anywhere.</p>

<p class="small">Two equivalent forms of service are provided here to meet the needs of<br/>
penitents. The absolution in these services may be pronounced only by a<br/>
bishop or priest. Another Christian may be asked to hear a confession,<br/>
but it must be made clear to the penitent that absolution will not be<br/>
pronounced; instead, a declaration of forgiveness is provided.</p>

<p class="small">When a confession is heard in a church building, the confessor may sit<br/>
inside the altar rails or in a place set aside to give greater privacy, and the<br/>
penitent kneels nearby. If preferred, the confessor and penitent may sit<br/>
face to face for a spiritual conference leading to absolution or a<br/>
declaration of forgiveness.</p>

<p class="small">When the penitent has confessed all serious sins troubling the conscience<br/>
and has given evidence of due contrition, the priest gives such counsel<br/>
and encouragement as are needed and pronounces the absolution. Before<br/>
giving absolution, the priest may assign to the penitent a psalm, prayer,<br/>
or hymn to be said, or something to be done, as a sign of penitence and <br/>
act of thanksgiving.</p>

<p class="small">The content of a confession is not normally a matter of subsequent<br/>
discussion. The secrecy of a confession is morally absolute for the<br/>
confessor, and must under no circumstances be broken.</p>
