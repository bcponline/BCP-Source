<h1>The Celebration and<br/>
Blessing of a Marriage</h1><br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<p class="rubric">
At the time appointed, the persons to be married, with their witnesses, <br/>
assemble in the church or some other appropriate place.<br/>
<br/>
During their entrance, a hymn, psalm, or anthem may be sung, <br/>
or instrumental music may be played.<br/>
<br/>
Then the Celebrant, facing the people and the persons to be married, <br/>
with the woman to the right and the man to the left, addresses the <br/>
congregation and says</p>

<p>Dearly beloved: We have come together in the presence of <br/>
God to witness and bless the joining together of this man and <br/>
this woman in Holy Matrimony. The bond and covenant of <br/>
marriage was established by God in creation, and our Lord <br/>
Jesus Christ adorned this manner of life by his presence and <br/>
first miracle at a wedding in Cana of Galilee. It signifies to us <br/>
the mystery of the union between Christ and his Church, and <br/>
Holy Scripture commends it to be honored among all people.<br/>
<br/>
The union of husband and wife in heart, body, and mind is <br/>
intended by God for their mutual joy; for the help and comfort <br/>
given one another in prosperity and adversity; and, when it is <br/>
God's will, for the procreation of children and their nurture <br/>
in the knowledge and love of the Lord. Therefore marriage is <br/>
not to be entered into unadvisedly or lightly, but reverently, <br/>
deliberately, and in accordance with the purposes for which it <br/>
was instituted by God.</p>

<p>Into this holy union <em>N.N.</em>. and <em>N.N.</em>. now come to be joined. 
<br/>
If any of you can show just cause why they may not lawfully be <br/>
married, speak now; or else for ever hold your peace.<br/>
</p>

<p class="rubric">Then the Celebrant says to the persons to be married<br/>
</p>

<p>I require and charge you both, here in the presence of God, <br/>
that if either of you know any reason why you may not be <br/>
united in marriage lawfully, and in accordance with God's <br/>
Word, you do now confess it.<br/>

them with your grace, that with true fidelity and steadfast love <br/>
they may honor and keep the promises and vows they make; <br/>
through Jesus Christ our Savior, who lives and reigns with <br/>
you in the unity of the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever. <br/>
