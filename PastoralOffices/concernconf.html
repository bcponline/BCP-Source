<h2 class="concern">Concerning the Service</h2>

<br/>
<p class="small">In the course of their Christian development, those baptized at an early <br/>
age are expected, when they are ready and have been duly prepared, to <br/>
make a mature public affirmation of their faith and commitment to the <br/>
responsibilities of their Baptism and to receive the laying on of hands by <br/>
the bishop.</p>

<p class="small">Those baptized as adults, unless baptized with laying on of hands by a <br/>
bishop, are also expected to make a public affirmation of their faith <br/>
and commitment to the responsibilities of their Baptism in the presence <br/>
of a bishop and to receive the laying on of hands.</p>

<p class="small">When there is no Baptism, the rites of Confirmation, Reception, and the <br/>
Reaffirmation of Baptismal Vows are administered in the following form.</p>

<p class="small">If desired, the hymn Gloria in excelsis may be sung immediately after <br/>
the opening versicles and before the salutation &quot;The Lord be with you.&quot;</p>

<p class="small">The Nicene Creed is not used at this service.</p>

<p class="small">It is appropriate that the oblations of bread and wine be presented by <br/>
persons newly confirmed.</p>
