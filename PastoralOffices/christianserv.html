<title>A Form of Commitment to Christian Service</title>

<h1>A Form of Commitment<br/>
to Christian Service</h1>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<p class="rubric">This form may be used when a person wishes to make or renew a<br/>
commitment to the service of Christ in the world, either in general terms,<br/>
or upon undertaking some special responsibility.<br/>
<br/>
It is essential that the person seeking to make or renew a commitment<br/>
prepare in advance, in consultation with the celebrant, the Act of<br/>
Commitment, which may be in the form either of a statement of intention<br/>
or of a series of questions and answers, but which should include a<br/>
reaffirmation of baptismal promises.<br/>
<br/>
Before the Offertory of the Eucharist, the person comes forward at the<br/>
invitation of the celebrant, and, standing before the congregation, makes<br/>
the Act of Commitment.<br/>
<br/>
After this, the Celebrant says these or similar words</p>

<p>May the Holy Spirit guide and strengthen you, that in this,<br/>
and in all things, you may do God's will in the service of the <br/>
kingdom of his Christ.&nbsp;<em>Amen.</em><br/>
<br/>
In the name of this congregation I commend you to this<br/>
work, and pledge you our prayers, encouragement, and<br/>
support.</p>

<hr>
<br/>
<br/>

<p class="rubric">The Celebrant then says this or some other appropriate prayer</p>

<p>Let us pray.<br/>
<br/>
Almighty God, look with favor upon <em>this person</em> who <em>has</em><br/>
now reaffirmed <em>his</em> commitment to follow Christ and to serve<br/>
in his name. Give <em>him</em> courage, patience, and vision; and<br/>
strengthen us all in our Christian vocation of witness to the<br/>
world, and of service to others; through Jesus Christ our<br/>
Lord.&nbsp;<em>Amen.</p>
<p class="rubric">A prayer for the special work in which the person will be engaged may<br/>
be added.<br/>
<br/>
The service then continues with the exchange of the Peace and the<br/>
Offertory.</p>
