<p><font size="2" face="Goudy Old Style"><i>When, for pastoral considerations, 
neither of the burial rites in this Book <br>
is deemed appropriate, the following form is used.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
</i>1. The body is received. The celebrant may meet the body and conduct <br>
t into the church or chapel, or it may be in place before the congregation <br>
assembles.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
2. Anthems from Holy Scripture or psalms may be sung or said, or a <br>
hymn may be sung.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
3. Prayer may be offered for the bereaved.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
4. One or more passages of Holy Scripture are read. Psalms, hymns, or <br>
anthems may follow the readings. If there is to be a Communion, the last <br>
Reading is from the Gospel.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
5. A homily may follow the Readings, and the Apostles' Creed may be <br>
recited.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
6. Prayer, including the Lord's Prayer, is offered for the deceased, for <br>
those who mourn, and for the Christian community, remembering the <br>
promises of God in Christ about eternal life.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
7. The deceased is commended to God, and the body is committed to its <br>
resting place. The committal may take place either where the preceding <br>
service has been held, or at the graveside.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
8. If there is a Communion, it precedes the commendation, and begins <br>
with the Peace and Offertory of the Eucharist. Any of the authorized <br>
eucharistic prayers may be used.</font></p>

<b><font size="4">Note:<br>
</font></b>&nbsp;<br>
<i><font size="2">The liturgy for the dead is an Easter liturgy. It finds all 
meaning in the <br>
resurrection. Because Jesus was raised from the dead, we too, shall be <br>
raised.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
The liturgy, therefore, is characterized by joy, in the certainty that <br>
&quot;neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor things present,
<br>
nor things to come, nor powers, nor height, nor depth, nor anything else <br>
in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ <br>
Jesus our Lord.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
This joy, however, does not make human grief unchristian. The very love <br>
we have for each other in Christ brings deep sorrow when we are parted <br>
by death. Jesus himself wept at the grave of his friend. So, while we <br>
rejoice that one we love has entered into the nearer presence of our Lord, <br>
we sorrow in sympathy with those who mourn.</font></i><p>&nbsp;</p>
