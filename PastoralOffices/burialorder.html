<h1>An Order for Burial</h1>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<p class="rubric">When, for pastoral considerations, neither of the burial rites in this Book <br/>
is deemed appropriate, the following form is used.</p>
<p class="small">1. The body is received. The celebrant may meet the body and conduct <br/>
it into the church or chapel, or it may be in place before the congregation <br/>
assembles.<br/>
<br/>
2. Anthems from Holy Scripture or psalms may be sung or said, or a <br/>
hymn may be sung.<br/>
<br/>
3. Prayer may be offered for the bereaved.<br/>
<br/>
4. One or more passages of Holy Scripture are read. Psalms, hymns, or <br/>
anthems may follow the readings. If there is to be a Communion, the last <br/>
Reading is from the Gospel.<br/>
<br/>
5. A homily may follow the Readings, and the Apostles' Creed may be <br/>
recited.<br/>
<br/>
6. Prayer, including the Lord's Prayer, is offered for the deceased, for <br/>
those who mourn, and for the Christian community, remembering the <br/>
promises of God in Christ about eternal life.<br/>
<br/>
7. The deceased is commended to God, and the body is committed to its <br/>
resting place. The committal may take place either where the preceding <br/>
service has been held, or at the graveside.<br/>
<br/>
8. If there is a Communion, it precedes the commendation, and begins <br/>
with the Peace and Offertory of the Eucharist. Any of the authorized <br/>
eucharistic prayers may be used.</p>

<p class="large"><strong>Note:</strong></p>

<p class="rubric">The liturgy for the dead is an Easter liturgy. It finds all meaning in the <br/>
resurrection. Because Jesus was raised from the dead, we too, shall be <br/>
raised.<br/>
<br/>
The liturgy, therefore, is characterized by joy, in the certainty that <br/>
&quot;neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor things present,
<br/>
nor things to come, nor powers, nor height, nor depth, nor anything else <br/>
in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ <br/>
Jesus our Lord.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This joy, however, does not make human grief unchristian. The very love <br/>
we have for each other in Christ brings deep sorrow when we are parted <br/>
by death. Jesus himself wept at the grave of his friend. So, while we <br/>
rejoice that one we love has entered into the nearer presence of our Lord, <br/>
we sorrow in sympathy with those who mourn.<p>&nbsp;</p>
