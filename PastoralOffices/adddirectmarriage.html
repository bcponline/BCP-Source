<p class="rubric">If Banns are to be published, the following form is used</p>

<p>I publish the  Banns of Marriage between N.N. of __________. <br/>
and N.N. of __________. If any of you know just cause why <br/>
they may not be joined together in Holy Matrimony, you are <br/>
bidden to declare it. This is the first (or second, or third) time <br/>
of asking.</p>

<p class="small">The Celebration and Blessing of a Marriage may be used with any<br/>
authorized liturgy for the Holy Eucharist. This service then replaces the <br/>
Ministry of the Word, and the Eucharist begins with the Offertory.<br/>
<br/>
After the Declaration of Consent, if there is to be a giving in marriage, or <br/>
presentation, the Celebrant asks</p>

<p>Who gives (presents) this woman to be married to this man?</p>

<p class="rubric">or the following</p>

<p>Who presents this woman and this man to be married to each other?</p>

<p class="small">To either question, the appropriate answer is, &quot;I do.&quot; If more than one <br/>
person responds, they do so together.</p>

<p class="small">For the Ministry of the Word it is fitting that the man and woman to be<br/>
married remain where they may conveniently hear the reading of<br/>
Scripture. They may approach the Altar, either for the exchange of vows,<br/>
or for the Blessing of the Marriage.</p>

<p class="small">It is appropriate that all remain standing until the conclusion of the<br/>
Collect. Seating may be provided for the wedding party, so that all may <br/>
be seated for the Lessons and the homily.</p>

<p class="small">The <a href="../General/Apostles_Creed.html">Apostles' Creed</a> may be recited after the Lessons, or after the homily,<br/>
if there is one.</p>

<p class="small">When desired, some other suitable symbol of the vows may be used in<br/>
place of the ring.</p>

<p class="small">At the Offertory, it is desirable that the bread and wine be presented to <br/>
the ministers by the newly married persons. They may then remain before <br/>
the Lord's Table and receive Holy Communion before other members of <br/>
the congregation.</p>
