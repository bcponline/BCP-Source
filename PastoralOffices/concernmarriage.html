<title>Concerning the Service:&nbsp; Marriage</title>

<h2 class="concern">Concerning the Service</h2>

<br/>
<p class="small">Christian marriage is a solemn and public covenant between a man and a<br/>
woman in the presence of God. In the Episcopal Church it is required that<br/>
one, at least, of the parties must be a baptized Christian; that the<br/>
ceremony be attested by at least two witnesses; and that the marriage<br/>
conform to the laws of the State and the canons of this Church.</p>

<p class="small">A priest or a bishop normally presides at the Celebration and Blessing<br/>
of a Marriage, because such ministers alone have the function of<br/>
pronouncing the nuptial blessing, and of celebrating the Holy Eucharist.</p>

<p class="small">When both a bishop and a priest are present and officiating, the bishop<br/>
should pronounce the blessing and preside at the Eucharist.</p>

<p class="small">A deacon, or an assisting priest, may deliver the charge, ask for the<br/>
Declaration of Consent, read the Gospel, and perform other assisting<br/>
functions at the Eucharist.</p>

<p class="small">Where it is permitted by civil law that deacons may perform marriages,<br/>
and no priest or bishop is available, a deacon may use the service which<br/>
follows, omitting the nuptial blessing which follows The Prayers.</p>

<p class="small">It is desirable that the Lessons from the Old Testament and the Epistles be<br/>
read by lay persons.</p>

<p class="small">In the opening exhortation (at the symbol of  N.N.), the full names of the<br/>
persons to be married are declared. Subsequently, only their Christian<br/>
names are used.</p>
