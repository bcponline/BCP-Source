<h1>The Reconciliation<br/>
of a Penitent</p>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<h4>Form One</h4>

<p class="rubric">The Penitent begins</p>

<p>Bless me, for I have sinned.</p>

<p class="rubric">The Priest says</p>

<p>The Lord be in your heart and upon your lips that you may<br/>
truly and humbly confess your sins: In the Name of the<br/>
Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. <em>Amen.</em></p>

<p class="rubric">Penitent</p>

<p>I confess to Almighty God, to his Church, and to you, that<br/>
I have sinned by my own fault in thought, word, and deed, in<br/>
things done and left undone; especially __________. For these<br/>
and all other sins which I cannot now remember, I am truly<br/>
sorry. I pray God to have mercy on me. I firmly intend<br/>
amendment of life, and I humbly beg forgiveness of God and<br/>
his Church, and ask you for counsel, direction, and absolution.</p>

<p class="rubric">Here the Priest may offer counsel, direction, and comfort.</p>

<br/>
<br/>
<p class="rightfoot"><em>Reconciliation</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;447</p>
<hr>
<br/>
<br/>

<p class="rubric">The Priest then pronounces this absolution</p>

<p>Our Lord Jesus Christ, who has left power to his Church to<br/>
absolve all sinners who truly repent and believe in him, of<br/>
his great mercy forgive you all your offenses; and by his<br/>
authority committed to me, I absolve you from all your sins:<br/>
In the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy<br/>
Spirit. <em>Amen.</em></p>

<p class="rubric">or this</p>

<p>Our Lord Jesus Christ, who offered himself to be sacrificed<br/>
for us to the Father, and who conferred power on his Church<br/>
to forgive sins, absolve you through my ministry by the grace<br/>
of the Holy Spirit, and restore you in the perfect peace of<br/>
the Church. <em>Amen.</em>

<p class="rubric">The Priest adds</p>

<p>The Lord has put away all your sins.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="rubric">Penitent</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks be to God.</p>

<p class="rubric">The Priest concludes</p>

<p>Go (or abide) in peace, and pray for me, a sinner.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<em>Declaration of Forgiveness<br/>
to be used by a Deacon or Lay Person</em><br/>
<br/>
Our Lord Jesus Christ, who offered himself to be sacrificed<br/>
for us to the Father, forgives your sins by the grace of the<br/>
Holy Spirit. <em>Amen.</em></p>

<br/>
<br/>
<p class="leftfoot">448&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Reconciliation</em></p>
<hr>
<br/>
<br/>

<h4>Form Two</h4>

<p class="rubric">The Priest and Penitent begin as follows</p>

<p>Have mercy on me, O God, according to your loving-kindness;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in your great compassion blot out my offenses.<br/>
Wash me through and through from my wickedness,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and cleanse me from my sin.<br/>
For I know my transgressions only too well,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;andmy sin is ever before me.<br/>
<br/>
Holy God, Holy and Mighty, Holy Immortal One,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have mercy upon us.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="rubric">Penitent</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pray for me, a sinner.</p>

<p class="rubric">Priest</p>

<p>May God in his love enlighten your heart, that you may<br/>
remember in truth all your sins and his unfailing mercy.<br/>
<em>Amen.</em></p>

<p class="rubric">The Priest may then say one or more of these or other appropriate verses<br/>
of Scripture, first saying</p>

<p>Hear the Word of God to all who truly turn to him.<br/>
<br/>
Come to me, all ye that travail and are heavy laden, and I<br/>
will refresh you.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="rubric">Matthew 11:28</span><br/>
<br/>
God so loved the world, that he gave his only-begotten Son,<br/>
to the end that all that believe in him should not perish, but<br/>
have everlasting life.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="rubric">John 3:16</span><br/>
<br/>
This is a true saying, and worthy of all men to be received,<br/>
that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/>
<span class="rubric">1 Timothy 1:15</span></p>

<br/>
<br/>
<p class="rightfoot"><em>Reconciliation</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;449</p>
<hr>
<br/>
<br/>

<p>If any man sin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus<br/>
Christ the righteous; and he is the perfect offering for our<br/>
sins, and not for ours only, but for the sins of the whole<br/>
world.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="rubric">1 John 2:1-2</span></p>

<p class="rubric">The Priest then continues</p>

<p>Now, in the presence of Christ, and of me, his minister,<br/>
confess your sins with a humble and obedient heart to<br/>
Almighty God, our Creator and our Redeemer.</p>

<p class="rubric">The Penitent says</p>

<p>Holy God, heavenly Father, you formed me from the dust in<br/>
your image and likeness, and redeemed me from sin and<br/>
death by the cross of your Son Jesus Christ. Through the<br/>
water of baptism you clothed me with the shining garment of<br/>
his righteousness, and established me among your children in<br/>
your kingdom. But I have squandered the inheritance of your<br/>
saints, and have wandered far in a land that is waste.<br/>
<br/>
Especially, I confess to you and to the Church&nbsp; .&nbsp; .&nbsp; .</p>

<p class="rubric">Here the Penitent confesses particular sins.</p>

<p>Therefore, O Lord, from these and all other sins I cannot<br/>
now remember, I turn to you in sorrow and repentance.<br/>
Receive me again into the arms of your mercy, and restore me<br/>
to the blessed company of your faithful people; through him<br/>
in whom you have redeemed the world, your Son our Savior<br/>
Jesus Christ.&nbsp;<em>Amen.</em></p>

<p class="rubric">The Priest may then offer words of comfort and counsel.<br/>
<br/>
Priest</p>

<p>Will you turn again to Christ as your Lord?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="rubric">Penitent</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will.</p>

<br/>
<br/>
<p class="leftfoot">450&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Reconciliation</em></p>
<hr>
<br/>
<br/>

<p class="rubric">Priest</p>

<p>Do you, then, forgive those who have sinned against you?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="rubric">Penitent</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I forgive them.</p>

<p class="rubric">Priest</p>

<p>May Almighty God in mercy receive your confession of<br/>
sorrow and of faith, strengthen you in all goodness, and by<br/>
the power of the Holy Spirit keep you in eternal life. <em>Amen.</em></p>

<p class="rubric">The Priest then lays a hand upon the penitent's head (or extends a hand<br/>
over the penitent), saying one of the following</p>

<p>Our Lord Jesus Christ, who offered himself to be sacrificed<br/>
for us to the Father, and who conferred power on his Church<br/>
to forgive sins, absolve you through my ministry by the grace<br/>
of the Holy Spirit, and restore you in the perfect peace of the<br/>
Church. <em>Amen.</em></p>

<p class="rubric">or this</p>

<p>Our Lord Jesus Christ, who has left power to his Church to<br/>
absolve all sinners who truly repent and believe in him, of<br/>
his great mercy forgive you all your offenses; and by his<br/>
authority committed to me, I absolve you from all your sins:<br/>
In the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy<br/>
Spirit. <em>Amen.</em></p>

<p class="rubric">The Priest concludes</p>

<p>Now there is rejoicing in heaven; for you were lost, and<br/>
are found; you were dead, and are now alive in Christ Jesus<br/>
our Lord.&nbsp; Go (<em>or</em> abide) in peace.&nbsp; The Lord has put away all<br/>
your sins.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="rubric">Penitent</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks be to God.</p>
