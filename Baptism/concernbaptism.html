<title>Concerning the Service:&nbsp; Holy Baptism</title>

<h2 class="concern">Concerning the Service</h2>

<br/>
<p class="small">Holy Baptism is full initiation by water and the Holy Spirit into<br/>
Christ's Body the Church. The bond which God establishes in Baptism<br/>
is indissoluble.</p>

<p class="small">Holy Baptism is appropriately administered within the Eucharist as the<br/>
chief service on a Sunday or other feast.</p>

<p class="small">The bishop, when present, is the celebrant; and is expected to preach the <br/>
Word and preside at Baptism and the Eucharist. At Baptism, the bishop <br/>
officiates at the Presentation and Examination of Candidates;<br/>
says the Thanksgiving over the Water; [consecrates the Chrism;] reads the <br/>
prayer, &quot;Heavenly Father, we thank you that by water and the Holy<br/>
Spirit;&quot; and officiates at what follows.</p>

<p class="small">In the absence of a bishop, a priest is the celebrant and presides at the <br/>
service. If a priest uses Chrism in signing the newly baptized, it must have <br/>
been previously consecrated by the bishop.</p>

<p class="small">Each candidate for Holy Baptism is to be sponsored by one or more<br/>
baptized persons.</p>

<p class="small">Sponsors of adults and older children present their candidates and<br/>
thereby signify their endorsement of the candidates and their intention <br/>
to support them by prayer and example in their Christian life. Sponsors of <br/>
infants, commonly called godparents, present their candidates, make<br/>
promises in their own names, and also take vows on behalf of their<br/>
candidates.</p>

<p class="small">It is fitting that parents be included among the godparents of their own <br/>
children. Parents and godparents are to be instructed in the meaning of <br/>
Baptism, in their duties to help the new Christians grow in the knowledge <br/>
and love of God, and in their responsibilities as members of his Church.</p>
