<p>Almighty God, we thank you that by the death and<br/>
resurrection of your Son Jesus Christ you have overcome sin<br/>
and brought us to yourself, and that by the sealing of your<br/>
Holy Spirit you have bound us to your service. Renew in<br/>
<em>these</em> your <em>servants</em> the covenant you made with <em>them</em> at <em>their</em><br/>
Baptism. Send <em>them</em> forth in the power of the Spirit to<br/>
perform the service you set before <em>them</em>; through Jesus Christ<br/>
your Son our Lord, who lives and reigns with you and the<br/>
Holy Spirit, one God, now and for ever. <em>Amen</em>.</p>
