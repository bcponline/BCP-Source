<title>Additional Directions: Holy Baptism</title>
</head>

<body>

<h2 class="direct">Additional Directions</h2>

<br/>
<p class="small">Holy Baptism is especially appropriate at the Easter Vigil, on the<br/>
Day of Pentecost, on All Saints' Day or the Sunday after All Saints'<br/>
Day, and on the Feast of the Baptism of our Lord (the First Sunday<br/>
after the Epiphany). It is recommended that, as far as possible,<br/>
Baptisms be reserved for these occasions or when a bishop is<br/>
present.</p>

<p class="small">If on any one of the above-named days the ministry of a bishop or<br/>
priest cannot be obtained, the bishop may specially authorize a<br/>
deacon to preside. In that case, the deacon omits the prayer over<br/>
the candidates, <a href="holybaptism.html#Prayer over Candidate">page 308</a>, and the formula and action which follow.</p>

<p class="small">These omitted portions of the rite may be administered on some<br/>
subsequent occasion of public baptism at which a bishop or priest<br/>
presides.</p>

<p class="small">If on the four days listed above there are no candidates for Baptism,<br/>
the <a href="../SpecialDays/EasterVigil.html#vows">Renewal of Baptismal vows, page 292</a>, may take the place of the<br/>
Nicene Creed at the Eucharist.</p>

<p class="small">If desired, the hymn Gloria in excelsis may be sung immediately after<br/>
the opening versicles and before the salutation &quot;The Lord be with you.&quot;</p>

<p class="small">When a bishop is present, or on other occasions for sufficient reason,<br/>
the Collect (page <a href="../Collects/varioust.html#Baptism">203</a> or 
<a href="../Collects/variousc.html#Baptism">254</a>) and one or more of the Lessons provided<br/>
for use at Baptism (<a href="../RCL/Various.html">page 928</a>) may be substituted for the Proper of the<br/>
Day.</p>

<p class="small">Lay persons may act as readers, and it is appropriate for sponsors to be <br/>
assigned this function. The petitions (<a href="holybaptism.html#prayers">page 305</a>) may also be led by one of <br/>
the sponsors.</p>

<p class="small">The Nicene Creed is not used at this service.</p>

<p class="small">If the Presentation of the Candidates does not take place at the font, then <br/>
before or during the petitions (<a href="holybaptism.html#prayers">page 305</a>), the ministers, candidates, and <br/>
sponsors go to the font for the Thanksgiving over the Water.</p>

<p class="small">If the movement to the font is a formal procession, a suitable psalm, such <br/>
as <a href="../Psalter/the_psalter.html#42">Psalm 42</a>, or a hymn or anthem, may be sung.</p>

<br/>

<p class="leftfoot">312&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Holy Baptism</em></p>
<hr>
<br/>
<br/>

<p class="small">Where practicable, the font is to be filled with clean water immediately <br/>
before the Thanksgiving over the Water.</p>

<p class="small">At the Thanksgiving over the Water, and at the administration of<br/>
Baptism, the celebrant, whenever possible, should face the people across<br/>
the font, and the sponsors should be so grouped that the people may have<br/>
a clear view of the action.</p>

<p class="small">After the Baptism, a candle (which may be lighted from the Paschal<br/>
Candle) may be given to each of the newly baptized or to a godparent.</p>

<p class="small">It may be found desirable to return to the front of the church for the<br/>
prayer, &quot;Heavenly Father, we thank you that by water and the Holy Spirit,&quot; <br/>
and the ceremonies that follow it. A suitable psalm, such as <a href="../Psalter/the_psalter.html#23">Psalm 23</a>, or a <br/>
hymn or anthem, may be sung during the procession.</p>

<p class="small">The oblations of bread and wine at the baptismal Eucharist may be<br/>
presented by the newly baptized or their godparents.</p>

<br/>

<h3>Conditional Baptism</h3>

<p class="rubric">If there is reasonable doubt that a person has been baptized with water, <br/>
&quot;In the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit&quot; <br/>
(which are the essential parts of Baptism), the person is baptized in the <br/>
usual manner, but this form of words is used</p>


<p>If you are not already baptized, <em>N</em>., I baptize you in the<br/>
name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.</p>

<br/>

<h3>Emergency Baptism</h3>


<p class="rubric">In case of emergency, any baptized person may administer Baptism<br/>
according to the following form.<br/>
<br/>
Using the given name of the one to be baptized (if known), pour water on<br/>
him or her, saying</p>


<p>I baptize you in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and<br/>
of the Holy Spirit.</p>

<br/>
<br/>
<p class="rightfoot"><em>Holy Baptism</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;313</p>
<hr>
<br/>
<br/>

<p class="rubric">The <a href="../General/paternoster.html">Lord's Prayer</a> is then said.<br/>
<br/>
Other prayers, such as the following, may be added</p>

<p>Heavenly Father, we thank you that by water and the Holy<br/>
Spirit you have bestowed on upon this your servant the<br/>
forgiveness of sin and have raised <em>him</em> to the new life of<br/>
grace. Strengthen <em>him,</em> O Lord, with your presence, enfold<br/>
<em>him</em> in the arms of your mercy, and keep <em>him</em> safe forever.</p>


<p class="rubric">The person who administers emergency Baptism should inform the priest<br/>
of the appropriate parish, so that the fact can be properly recorded.<br/>
<br/>
If the baptized person recovers, the Baptism should be recognized<br/>
at a public celebration of the Sacrament with a bishop or priest<br/>
presiding, and the person baptized under emergency conditions,<br/>
together with the sponsors or godparents, taking part in everything<br/>
except the administration of the water.</p>
