<h2 class="concern">Concerning the Daily Office Lectionary</h2>

<br/>
<p class="small">The Daily Office Lectionary is arranged in a two-year cycle. Year One<br/>
begins on the First Sunday of Advent preceding odd-numbered years, and <br/>
Year Two begins on the First Sunday of Advent preceding even-numbered <br/>
years.  (Thus, on the First Sunday of Advent, 1976, the Lectionary for <br/>
Year One is begun.)</p>

<p class="small">Three Readings are provided for each Sunday and weekday in each of the <br/>
two years.  Two of the Readings may be used in the morning and one in <br/>
the evening; or, if the Office is read only once in the day, all three <br/>
Readings may be used.  When the Office is read twice in the day, it is <br/>
suggested that the Gospel Reading be used in the evening in Year One, <br/>
and in the morning in Year Two.  If two Readings are desired at both <br/>
Offices, the Old Testament Reading for the alternate year is used as the <br/>
First Reading at Evening Prayer.</p>

<p class="small">When more than one Reading is used at an Office, the first is always <br/>
from the Old Testament (or the Apocrypha).</p>

<p class="small">When a Major Feast interrupts the sequence of Readings, they may be <br/>
re-ordered by lengthening, combining, or omitting some of them, to <br/>
secure continuity or avoid repetition.</p>

<p class="small">Any Reading may be lengthened at discretion.  Suggested lengthenings are <br/>
shown in parentheses.</p>

<p class="small">In this Lectionary (except in the weeks from 4 Advent to I Epiphany, <br/>
and Palm Sunday to 2 Easter), the Psalms are arranged in a seven-week <br/>
pattern which recurs throughout the year, except for appropriate <br/>
variations in Lent and Easter Season.</p>

<p class="small">In the citation of the Psalms, those for the morning are given first, <br/>
and then those for the evening.  At the discretion of the officiant, however, <br/>
any of the Psalms appointed for a given day may be used in the morning <br/>
or in the evening.  Likewise, Psalms appointed for any day may be used on <br/>
any other day in the same week, except on major Holy Days.</p>

<p class="small">Brackets and parentheses are used (brackets in the case of whole Psalms, <br/>
parentheses in the case of verses) to indicate Psalms and verses of Psalms <br/>
which may be omitted. In some instances, the entire portion of the Psalter <br/>
assigned to a given Office has been bracketed, and alternative Psalmody <br/>
provided. Those who desire to recite the Psalter in its entirety should, in <br/>
each instance, use the bracketed Psalms rather than the alternatives.</p>

<p class="small">Antiphons drawn from the Psalms themselves, or from the opening <br/>
sentences given in the Offices, or from other passages of Scripture, may <br/>
be used with the Psalms and biblical Canticles. The antiphons may be <br/>
sung or said at the beginning and end of each Psalm or Canticle, or may <br/>
be used as refrains after each verse or group of verses.</p>

<p class="small">On Special Occasions, the officiant may select suitable Psalms and <br/>
Readings.</p>
