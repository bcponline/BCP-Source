<br/>
<br/>

<p><em>2. Of God the Son</em><br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<p><strong>Prefaces for Seasons</strong></p>

<p class="rubric">To be used on Sundays and weekdays alike, except as otherwise<br/>
appointed for Holy Days and Various Occasions</p>

<br/>
<p><em>Advent</em><br/>
<br/>
Because thou didst send thy beloved Son to redeem us from<br/>
sin and death, and to make us heirs in him of everlasting life;<br/>
that when he shall come again in power and great triumph to<br/>
judge the world, we may without shame or fear rejoice to<br/>
behold his appearing.</p>

<br/>
<p><em>Incarnation</em><br/>
<br/>
Because thou didst give Jesus Christ, thine only Son, to be<br/>
born for us; who, by the mighty power of the Holy Ghost,<br/>
was made very Man of the substance of the Virgin Mary his<br/>
mother; that we might be delivered from the bondage of sin,<br/>
and receive power to become thy children.</p>

<br/>
<br/>
<p class="rightfoot"><em>Holy Eucharist I</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;345</p>
<hr>
<br/>
<br/>

<p><em>Epiphany</em><br/>
<br/>
Because in the mystery of the Word made flesh, thou hast<br/>
caused a new light to shine in our hearts, to give the knowledge<br/>
of thy glory in the face of thy Son Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>

<br/>
<p><em>Lent</em><br/>
<br/>
Through Jesus Christ our Lord; who was in every way<br/>
tempted as we are, yet did not sin; by whose grace we are<br/>
able to triumph over every evil, and to live no longer unto<br/>
ourselves, but unto him who died for us and rose again.</p>

<p class="rubric">or this</p>

<p>Who dost bid thy faithful people cleanse their hearts, and<br/>
prepare with joy for the Paschal feast; that, fervent in prayer<br/>
and in works of mercy, and renewed by thy Word and<br/>
Sacraments, they may come to the fullness of grace which<br/>
thou hast prepared for those who love thee.</p>

<br/>
<p><em>Holy Week</em></p>

<p>Through Jesus Christ our Lord; who for our sins was lifted<br/>
high upon the cross, that he might draw the whole world to<br/>
himself; who by his suffering and death became the author of<br/>
eternal salvation for all who put their trust in him.</p>

<br/>
<p><em>Easter</em></p>

<p>But chiefly are we bound to praise thee for the glorious<br/>
resurrection of thy Son Jesus Christ our Lord; for he is the<br/>
very Paschal Lamb, who was sacrificed for us, and hath<br/>
taken away the sin of the world; who by his death hath<br/>
destroyed death, and by his rising to life again hath won for<br/>
us everlasting life.</p>

<br/>
<br/>
<p class="leftfoot">346&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Holy Eucharist I</em></p>
<hr>
<br/>
<br/>

<p><em>Ascension</em></p>

<p>Through thy dearly beloved Son Jesus Christ our Lord; who<br/>
after his glorious resurrection manifestly appeared to his<br/>
disciples; and in their sight ascended into heaven, to prepare<br/>
a place for us; that where he is, there we might also be, and<br/>
reign with him in glory.</p>

<br/>
<p><em>Pentecost</em></p>

<p>Through Jesus Christ our Lord; according to whose true<br/>
promise the Holy Ghost came down [on this day] from<br/>
heaven, lighting upon the disciples, to teach them and to lead<br/>
them into all truth; uniting peoples of many tongues in the<br/>
confession of one faith, and giving to thy Church the power<br/>
to serve thee as a royal priesthood, and to preach the<br/>
Gospel to all nations.</p>

<br/>
<p><strong>Prefaces for Other Occasions</strong></p>

<p><em>Trinity Sunday</em></p>

<p>For with thy co-eternal Son and Holy Spirit, thou art one God,<br/>
one Lord, in Trinity of Persons and in Unity of Substance;<br/>
and we celebrate the one and equal glory of thee, O Father,<br/>
and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.</p>

<br/>
<p><em>All Saints</em></p>

<p>Who, in the multitude of thy saints, hast compassed us about<br/>
with so great a cloud of witnesses, that we, rejoicing in their<br/>
fellowship, may run with patience the race that is set before<br/>
us; and, together with them, may receive the crown of glory<br/>
that fadeth not away.</p>

<br/>
<br/>
<p class="rightfoot"><em>Holy Eucharist I</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;347</p>
<hr>
<br/>
<br/>

<p><em>A Saint</em></p>

<p>For the wonderful grace and virtue declared in all thy saints,<br/>
who have been chosen vessels of thy grace, and the lights<br/>
of the world in their generations.</p>

<p class="rubric">or this</p>

<p>Who in the obedience of thy saints hast given us an example<br/>
of righteousness, and in their eternal joy a glorious pledge of<br/>
the hope of our calling.</p>

<p class="rubric">or this</p>

<p>Because thou are greatly glorified in the assembly of thy saints.<br/>
All thy creatures praise thee, and thy faithful servants bless<br/>
thee, confessing before the rulers of this world the great Name<br/>
of thine only Son.</p>

<br/>
<p><em>Apostles and Ordinations</em></p>

<p>Through the great shepherd of thy flock, Jesus Christ our<br/>
Lord; who after his resurrection sent forth his apostles to<br/>
preach the Gospel and to teach all nations; and promised to<br/>
be with them always, even unto the end of the ages.</p>

<br/>
<p><em>Dedication of a Church</em></p>

<p>Through Jesus Christ our great High Priest; in whom we are<br/>
built up as living stones of a holy temple, that we might offer<br/>
before thee a sacrifice of praise and prayer which is holy and<br/>
pleasing in thy sight.</p>

<br/>
<p><em>Baptism</em></p>

<p>Because in Jesus Christ our Lord thou hast received us as thy<br/>
sons and daughters, made us citizens of thy kingdom, and<br/>
given us the Holy Spirit to guide us into all truth.</p>

<p class="leftfoot">348&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Holy Eucharist I</em></p>
<hr>
<br/>
<br/>

<p><em>Marriage</em></p>

<p>Because in the love of wife and husband, thou hast given us<br/>
an image of the heavenly Jerusalem, adorned as a bride for<br/>
her bridegroom, thy Son Jesus Christ our Lord; who loveth<br/>
her and gave himself for her, that he might make the whole<br/>
creation new.</p>

<br/>
<p><em><a name="Dead">Commemoration of the Dead</a></em></p>

<p>Through Jesus Christ our Lord; who rose victorious from the<br/>
dead, and doth comfort us with the blessed hope of<br/>
everlasting life; for to thy faithful people, O Lord, life is<br/>
changed, not ended; and when our mortal body doth lie in<br/>
death, there is prepared for us a dwelling place eternal in the<br/>
heavens.</p>
