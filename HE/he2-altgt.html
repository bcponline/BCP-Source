which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling <br>
of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the <br>
prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your <br>
Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from <br>
the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. <br>

gave it to his disciples, and said, &quot;Take, eat: This is my Body, <br>

After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given <br>
thanks, he gave it to them, and said, &quot;Drink this, all of you: <br>
This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you <br>
and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink <br>
