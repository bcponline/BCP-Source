given thanks, he gave it to them, saying, &quot;Drink ye all of this;<br/>

death, his mighty resurrection and glorious ascension;<br/>
rendering unto thee most hearty thanks for the innumerable<br/>
benefits procured unto us by the same.</p>

hear us; and, of thy almighty goodness, vouchsafe to bless<br/>
and sanctify, with thy Word and Holy Spirit, these thy gifts<br/>
and creatures of bread and wine; that we, receiving them<br/>

we, and all thy whole Church, may obtain remission of our<br/>
sins, and all other benefits of his passion.</p>
