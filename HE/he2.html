for yourself, and, when we had fallen into sin and become <br/>
subject to evil and death, you, in your mercy, sent Jesus <br/>
Christ, your only and eternal Son, to share our human <br/>
nature, to live and die as one of us, to reconcile us to you, the <br/>
God and Father of all.<br/>

or to lay a hand upon it; and at the words concerning the cup, to hold or <br/>
place a hand upon the cup and any other vessel containing wine to be <br/>
consecrated.</p>

<p>On the night he was handed over to suffering and death, our <br/>
Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks <br/>
to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, &quot;Take, <br/>
eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the <br/>
remembrance of me.&quot;</p>

This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you <br/>
and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink <br/>
it, do this for the remembrance of me.&quot;<br/>

Sanctify them by your Holy Spirit to be for your people the <br/>
Body and Blood of your Son, the holy food and drink of new <br/>
