<p class="rubric">or this</p>

<p><em>2. Of God the Son</em><br/>

<br/>

<p><em>3. Of God the Holy Spirit</em><br/>
<br/>
For by water and the Holy Spirit you have made us a new <br/>
people in Jesus Christ our Lord, to show forth your glory in <br/>
all the world.</p>

<br/>
<p><strong>Prefaces for Seasons</strong></p>

<p class="rubric">To be used on Sundays, and weekdays alike, except as otherwise <br/>
appointed for Holy Days and Various Occasions</p>

<br/>
<p><em>Advent</em><br/>
<br/>
Because you sent your beloved Son to redeem us from sin and <br/>
death, and to make us heirs in him of everlasting life; that <br/>
when he shall come again in power and great triumph to <br/>
judge the world, we may without shame or fear rejoice to <br/>
behold his appearing.</p>

<br/>
<p><em>Incarnation</em><br/>
<br/>
Because you gave Jesus Christ, your only Son, to be born for <br/>
us; who, by the mighty power of the Holy Spirit, was made <br/>
perfect Man of the flesh of the Virgin Mary his mother; so <br/>
that we might be delivered from the bondage of sin, and <br/>
receive power to become your children.</p>

<br/>
<p><em>Epiphany</em><br/>
<br/>
Because in the mystery of the Word made flesh, you have <br/>
caused a new light to shine in our hearts, to give the <br/>
knowledge of your glory in the face of your son Jesus Christ <br/>
our Lord.</p>

<br/>
<br/>
<p class="leftfoot">378&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Holy Eucharist II</em></p>

<br/>

<p><em>Lent</em><br/>
<br/>
Through Jesus Christ our Lord; who was tempted in every <br/>
way as we are, yet did not sin. By his grace we are able to <br/>
triumph over every evil, and to live no longer for ourselves <br/>
alone, but for him who died for us and rose again.</p>

<p class="rubric">or this</p>

<p>You bid your faithful people cleanse their hearts, and prepare <br/>
with joy for the Paschal feast; that, fervent in prayer and in <br/>
works of mercy, and renewed by your Word and Sacraments, <br/>
they may come to the fullness of grace which you have <br/>
prepared for those who love you.</p>

<br/>
<p><em>Holy Week</em><br/>
<br/>
Through Jesus Christ our Lord. For our sins he was lifted high <br/>
upon the cross, that he might draw the whole world to <br/>
himself; and, by his suffering and death, he became the <br/>
source of eternal salvation for all who put their trust in him.</p>

<br/>
<p><em>Easter</em><br/>
<br/>
But chiefly are we bound to praise you for the glorious <br/>
resurrection of your Son Jesus Christ our Lord; for he is the <br/>
true Paschal Lamb, who was sacrificed for us, and has taken <br/>
away the sin of the world. By his death he has destroyed <br/>
death, and by his rising to life again he has won for us <br/>
everlasting life.</p>

<br/>
<p><em>Ascension</em><br/>
<br/>
Through your dearly beloved Son Jesus Christ our Lord. <br/>
After his glorious resurrection he openly appeared to his <br/>
disciples, and in their sight ascended into heaven, to prepare <br/>
a place for us; that where he is, there we might also be, and <br/>
reign with him in glory.</p>

<br/>
<br/>
<p class="rightfoot"><em>Holy Eucharist II</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;379</p>

<br/>
<br/>

<p><em>Pentecost</em><br/>
<br/>
Through Jesus Christ our Lord. In fulfillment of his true <br/>
promise, the Holy Spirit came down [on this day] from <br/>
heaven, lighting upon the disciples, to teach them and to lead <br/>
them into all truth; uniting peoples of many tongues in the <br/>
confession of one faith, and giving to your Church the power <br/>
to serve you as a royal priesthood, and to preach the Gospel <br/>
to all nations.</p>

<br/>
<p><strong>Prefaces for Other Occasions</strong></p>

<p><em>Trinity Sunday</em><br/>
<br/>
For with your co-eternal Son and Holy Spirit, you are one <br/>
God, one Lord, in Trinity of Persons and in Unity of Being; <br/>
and we celebrate the one and equal glory of you, O Father, <br/>
and of the Son, and of the Holy
Spirit.</p>

<br/>
<p><em>All Saints</em><br/>
<br/>
For in the multitude of your saints you have surrounded us <br/>
with a great cloud of witnesses, that we might rejoice in their <br/>
fellowship, and run with endurance the race that is set before <br/>
us; and, together with them, receive the crown of glory that <br/>
never fades away.</p>

<br/>
<p><em>A Saint</em><br/>
<br/>
For the wonderful grace and virtue declared in all your saints, <br/>
who have been the chosen vessels of your grace, and the lights <br/>
of the world in their generations.</p>

<p class="rubric">or this</p>

<p>Because in the obedience of your saints you have given us an <br/>
example of righteousness, and in their eternal joy a glorious <br/>
pledge of the hope of our calling.</p>

<br/>
<br/>
<p class="leftfoot">380&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Holy Eucharist II</em></p>
<hr>
<br/>
<br/>

<p class="rubric">or this</p>

<p>Because you are greatly glorified in the assembly of your <br/>
saints. All your creatures praise you, and your faithful <br/>
servants bless you, confessing before the rulers of this world <br/>
the great Name of your only Son.</p>

<br/>
<p><em><a name="Apostles and Ordinations">Apostles and Ordinations</a></em><br/>
<br/>
Through the great shepherd of your flock, Jesus Christ our <br/>
Lord; who after his resurrection sent forth his apostles to <br/>
preach the Gospel and to teach all nations; and promised to <br/>
be with them always, even to the end of the ages.</p>

<br/>
<p><em><a name="Dedication of a Church">Dedication of a Church</a></em><br/>
<br/>
Through Jesus Christ our great High Priest; in whom we are <br/>
built up as living stones of a holy temple, that we might offer <br/>
before you a sacrifice of praise and prayer which is holy and <br/>
pleasing in your sight.</p>

<br/>
<p><em><a name="Baptism">Baptism</a></em><br/>
<br/>
Because in Jesus Christ our Lord you have received us as your <br/>
sons and daughters, made us citizens of your kingdom, and <br/>
given us the Holy Spirit to guide us into all truth.</p>

<br/>
<p><em><a name="Marriage">Marriage</a></em><br/>
<br/>
Because in the love of wife and husband, you have given us <br/>
an image of the heavenly Jerusalem, adorned as a bride for <br/>
her bridegroom, your Son Jesus Christ our Lord; who loves <br/>
her and gave himself for her, that he might make the whole <br/>
creation new.</p>

<p><em><a name="Commendation of the Dead">Commemoration of the Dead</a></em><br/>
<br/>
Through Jesus Christ our Lord; who rose victorious from the <br/>
dead, and comforts us with the blessed hope of everlasting <br/>
life. For to your faithful people, O Lord, life is changed, not <br/>
ended; and when our mortal body lies in death, there is <br/>
prepared for us a dwelling place eternal in the heavens.</p>
