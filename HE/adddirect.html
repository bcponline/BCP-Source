<title>Additional Directions:&nbsp; Holy Eucharist</title>
</head>

<body>

<h2 class="direct">Additional Directions</h2>

<p class="small">The Holy Table is spread with a clean white cloth during the
celebration.</p>

<p class="small">When the Great Litany is sung or said immediately before the Eucharist, <br/>
the Litany concludes with the Kyries, and the Eucharist begins with the <br/>
Salutation and the Collect of the Day. The Prayers of the People following <br/>
the Creed may be omitted.</p>

<p class="small">When a psalm is used, it may be concluded with Gloria Patri. In <br/>
Rite One services, the following form of the Gloria may be used:</p>

<p>Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, *<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and to the Holy Ghost:<br/>
<br/>
As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, *<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;world without end. Amen.</p>

<p class="smaller">The Kyrie eleison (or &quot;Lord, have mercy&quot;) may be sung or said in <br/>
threefold, sixfold, or ninefold form. The Trisagion, &quot;Holy God&quot;, <br/>
may be sung or said three times, or antiphonally.</p>

<p class="small">Gloria in excelsis, or the hymn used in place of it, is sung or said from <br/>
Christmas Day through the Feast of the Epiphany; on Sundays from <br/>
Easter Day through the Day of Pentecost, on all the days of Easter Week, <br/>
and on Ascension Day; and at other times as desired; but it is not used on <br/>
the Sundays or ordinary weekdays of Advent or Lent.</p>

<p class="small">It is desirable that the Lessons be read from a lectern or pulpit, and that <br/>
the Gospel be read from the same lectern, or from the pulpit, or from the <br/>
midst of the congregation. It is desirable that the Lessons and the Gospel be <br/>
read from a book or books of appropriate size and dignity.</p>

<p class="small">When a portion of the congregation is composed of persons whose native <br/>
tongue is other than English, a reader appointed by the celebrant may <br/>
read the Gospel in the language of the people, either in place of, or in <br/>
addition to, the Gospel in English.</p>

<p class="small" id="No Communion">If there is no Communion, all that is appointed through the Prayers of<br/>
the People may be said. (If it is desired to include a Confession of Sin, the</p>

<p class="small">service begins with the Penitential Order.) A hymn or anthem may then <br/>
be sung, and the offerings of the people received. The service may then <br/>
conclude with the Lord's Prayer; and with either the Grace or a blessing, <br/>
or with the exchange of the Peace.</p>

<p class="small">In the absence of a priest, all that is described above, except for the <br/>
blessing, may be said by a deacon, or, if there is no deacon, by a lay reader.</p>

<p class="small">The greeting, &quot;The peace of the Lord be always with you,&quot; is addressed <br/>
to the entire assembly. In the exchange between individuals which may <br/>
follow, any appropriate words of greeting may be used. If preferred, the <br/>
exchange of the Peace may take place at the time of the administration of <br/>
the Sacrament (before or after the sentence of Invitation).</p>

<p class="small">Necessary announcements may be made before the service, after the <br/>
Creed, before the Offertory, or at the end of the service, as convenient.</p>

<p class="small">It is the function of a deacon to make ready the Table for the celebration, <br/>
preparing and placing upon it the bread and cup of wine. It is customary <br/>
to add a little water to the wine. The deacon may be assisted by other <br/>
ministers.</p>

<p class="small">During the Great Thanksgiving, it is appropriate that there be only <br/>
one chalice on the Altar, and, if need be, a flagon of wine from which <br/>
additional chalices may be filled after the Breaking of the Bread.</p>

<p class="small">The following anthem may be used at the Breaking of the Bread:</p>

<p>Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have mercy on us.<br/>
Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have mercy on us.<br/>
Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;grant us peace.</p>

<p class="small">While the people are coming forward to receive Communion, the <br/>
celebrant receives the Sacrament in both kinds. The bishops, priests, and <br/>
deacons at the Holy Table then communicate, and after them the people.</p>

<p class="small">Opportunity is always to be given to every communicant to receive <br/>
the consecrated Bread and Wine separately. But the Sacrament may be</p>

<br/>
<br/>
<p class="rightfoot"><em>Additional Directions</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;407</p>
<hr>
<br/>
<br/>

<p class="small">received in both kinds simultaneously, in a manner approved by the <br/>
bishop.</p>

<p class="small">When the celebrant is assisted by a deacon or another priest, it is <br/>
customary for the celebrant to administer the consecrated Bread and the <br/>
assistant the Chalice. When several deacons or priests are present, some <br/>
may administer the Bread and others the Wine. In the absence of <br/>
sufficient deacons and priests, lay persons licensed by the bishop <br/>
according to the canon may administer the Chalice.</p>

<p class="small" id="Additional Consecration">If the consecrated Bread or Wine does not suffice for the number<br/>
of communicants, the celebrant is to return to the Holy Table, and <br/>
consecrate more of either or both, by saying</p>

<p>Hear us, O heavenly Father, and with thy (your) Word and <br/>
Holy Spirit bless and sanctify this bread (wine) that it, also, <br/>
may be the Sacrament of the precious Body (Blood) of thy <br/>
(your) Son Jesus Christ our Lord, who took bread (the cup) <br/>
and said, &quot;This is my Body (Blood).&quot; <em>Amen.</em></p>

<p class="small">or else the celebrant may consecrate more of both kinds, saying again the<br/>
words of the Eucharistic Prayer, beginning with the words which follow<br/>
the Sanctus, and ending with the Invocation (in the case of Eucharistic<br/>
Prayer C, ending with the narrative of the Institution).</p>

<p class="small">When the service of a priest cannot be obtained, the bishop may, at <br/>
discretion, authorize a deacon to distribute Holy Communion to the <br/>
congregation from the reserved Sacrament in the following manner:</p>

<p class="small">1. After the Liturgy of the Word (and the receiving of the people's <br/>
offering), the deacon reverently places the consecrated Sacrament on the <br/>
Altar, during which time a communion hymn may be sung.</p>

<p class="small">2. The Lord's Prayer is then said, the deacon first saying, &quot;Let us pray in <br/>
the words our Savior Christ hath (has) taught us.&quot;</p>

<p class="small">3. And then, omitting the breaking of the Bread, the deacon proceeds <br/>
with what follows in the liturgy as far as the end of the postcommunion <br/>
prayer, and then dismisses the people.</p>

<p class="small">If any of the consecrated Bread or Wine remain, apart from any which <br/>
may be required for the Communion of the sick, or of others who for </p>

<br/>
<br/>
<p class="leftfoot">408&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Additional Directions</em></p>

<br/>
<br/>

<p>weighty cause could not be present at the celebration, or for the <br/>
administration of Communion by a deacon to a congregation when no <br/>
priest is available, the celebrant or deacon, and other communicants, <br/>
reverently eat and drink it, either after the Communion of the people or <br/>
after the Dismissal.</p>

<p class="small">A hymn may be sung before or after the postcommunion prayer.</p>

<br/>
<p><em>Disciplinary Rubrics</em></p>

<p class="small">If the priest knows that a person who is living a notoriously evil life <br/>
intends to come to Communion, the priest shall speak to that person <br/>
privately, and tell <em>him</em> that <em>he</em> may not come to the Holy Table until <em>he</em> <br/>
has given clear proof of repentance and amendment of life.</p>

<p class="small">The priest shall follow the same procedure with those who have done <br/>
wrong to their neighbors and are a scandal to the other members of the <br/>
congregation, not allowing such persons to receive Communion until <br/>
they have made restitution for the wrong they have done, or have at least <br/>
promised to do so.</p>

<p class="small">When the priest sees that there is hatred between members of the <br/>
congregation, <em>he</em> shall speak privately to them, telling them that they <br/>
may not receive Communion until they have forgiven each other. <br/>
And if the person or persons on one side truly forgive the others and <br/>
desire and promise to make up for their faults, but those on the other side <br/>
refuse to forgive, the priest shall allow those who are penitent to come to <br/>
Communion, but not those who are stubborn.</p>

<p class="small">In all such cases, the priest is required to notify the bishop, within <br/>
fourteen days at the most, giving the reasons for refusing Communion.</p>
