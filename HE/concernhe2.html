<h2 class="concern">Concerning the Celebration</h2>

<br/>
<p class="small">It is the bishop's prerogative, when
present, to be the principal<br/>
celebrant at the Lord's Table, and to preach the Gospel.</p>

<p class="small">At all celebrations of the Liturgy, it is fitting that the principal<br/>
celebrant, whether bishop or priest, be assisted by other priests, and<br/>
by deacons and lay persons.</p>

<p class="small">It is appropriate that the other priests present stand with the celebrant at <br/>
the Altar, and join in the consecration of the gifts, in breaking the Bread, <br/>
and in distributing Communion.</p>

<p class="small">A deacon should read the Gospel and may lead the Prayers of the People.<br/>
Deacons should also serve at the Lord's Table, preparing and placing on <br/>
it the offerings of bread and wine, and assisting in the ministration of the <br/>
sacrament to the people. In the absence of a deacon, these duties may be <br/>
performed by an assisting priest.</p>

<p class="small">Lay persons appointed by the celebrant should normally be assigned the<br/>
reading of the Lessons which precede the Gospel, and may lead the<br/>
Prayers of the People.</p>

<p class="small">Morning or Evening Prayer may be used in place of all that precedes the<br/>
Peace and the Offertory, provided that a lesson from the Gospel is always <br/>
included, and that the intercessions conform to the directions given for <br/>
the Prayers of the People.</p>

<p class="small">Additional Directions are on <a href="adddirect.html">page 406</a>.</p>
