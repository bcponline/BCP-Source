<h3>The Decalogue: Traditional</h3>

<p>God spake these words, and said:<br/>
I am the Lord thy God who brought thee out of the land of<br/>
Egypt, out of the house of bondage. Thou shalt have none<br/>
other gods but me.<br/>
<em>Lord have mercy upon us,<br/>
and incline our hearts to keep this law</em>.</p>

<br/>
<br/>
<p class="rightfoot"><em>Decalogue I</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;317</p>
<hr>
<br/>
<br/>

<p>Thou shalt not make to thyself any graven image, nor the<br/>
likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or in the earth<br/>
beneath, or in the water under the earth; thou shalt not bow<br/>
down to them, nor worship them.<br/>
<em>Lord have mercy upon us,<br/>
and incline our hearts to keep this law</em>.</p>

<p>Thou shalt not take the Name of the Lord thy God in vain.<br/>
<em>Lord have mercy upon us,<br/>
and incline our hearts to keep this law.</em></p>

<p>Remember that thou keep holy the Sabbath day.<br/>
<em>Lord have mercy upon us,<br/>
and incline our hearts to keep this law</em>.</p>

<p>Honor thy father and thy mother.<br/>
<em>Lord have mercy upon us,<br/>
and incline our hearts to keep this law</em>.</p>

<p>Thou shalt do no murder.<br/>
<em>Lord have mercy upon us,<br/>
and incline our hearts to keep this law</em>.</p>

<p>Thou shalt not commit adultery.<br/>
<em>Lord have mercy upon us,<br/>
and incline our hearts to keep this law.</em></p>

<p>Thou shalt not steal.<br/>
<em>Lord have mercy upon us,<br/>
and incline our hearts to keep this law.</em></p>

<p>Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor.<br/>
<em>Lord have mercy upon us,<br/>
and incline our hearts to keep this law</em>.</p>

<p>Thou shalt not covet.<br/>
<em>Lord have mercy upon us,<br/>
and write all these thy laws in our hearts, we beseech thee.</em></p>
