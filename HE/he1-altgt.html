<p class="rubric">Then, facing the Holy Table, the Celebrant proceeds</p>

<p>It is very meet, right, and our bounden duty, that we should<br/>
at all times, and in all places, give thanks unto thee, O Lord,<br/>
holy Father, almighty, everlasting God.</p>

<p class="rubric">Here a <a href="pphe1.html"> Proper Preface</a> is sung or said on all Sundays, and on other<br/>
occasions as appointed.</p>

<p>Therefore with Angels and Archangels, and with all the<br/>
company of heaven, we laud and magnify thy glorious<br/>
Name; evermore praising thee, and saying,</p>

<p class="rubric">Celebrant and People</p>

<p>Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of Hosts:<br/>
Heaven and earth are full of thy glory.<br/>
Glory be to thee, O Lord Most High.</p>

<p class="rubric">Here may be added</p>

<p>Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.<br/>
Hosanna in the highest.</p>

<p class="rubric">The people kneel or stand.</p>

<p class="rubric">Then the Celebrant continues</p>

<p>All glory be to thee, O Lord our God, for that thou didst<br/>
create heaven and earth, and didst make us in thine own<br/>
image; and, of thy tender mercy, didst give thine only Son<br/>
Jesus Christ to take our nature upon him, and to suffer death<br/>
upon the cross for our redemption. He made there a full and<br/>
perfect sacrifice for the whole world; and did institute, and in<br/>
his holy Gospel command us to continue, a perpetual<br/>
memory of that his precious death and sacrifice, until his<br/>
coming again.</p>

<p class="rubric">At the following words concerning the bread, the Celebrant is to hold<br/>
it, or lay a hand upon it; and at the words concerning the cup, to hold or<br/>
place a hand upon the cup and any other vessel containing wine to be<br/>
consecrated</p>

<p>For in the night in which he was betrayed, he took bread;<br/>
and when he had given thanks to thee, he broke it, and gave it<br/>
to his disciples, saying, &quot;Take, eat, this is my Body, which is<br/>
given for you. Do this in remembrance of me.&quot;</p>

<p>Likewise, after supper, he took the cup; and when he had<br/>
given thanks, he gave it to them, saying, &quot;Drink this, all of<br/>
you; for this is my Blood of the New Covenant, which is shed<br/>
for you, and for many, for the remission of sins. Do this, as<br/>
oft as ye shall drink it, in remembrance of me.&quot;</p>

<p>Wherefore, O Lord and heavenly Father, we thy people do<br/>
celebrate and make, with these thy holy gifts which we now<br/>
offer unto thee, the memorial thy Son hath commanded us to<br/>
make; having in remembrance his blessed passion and precious<br/>
death, his mighty resurrection and glorious ascension; and<br/>
looking for his coming again with power and great glory.</p>

<p>And we most humbly beseech thee, O merciful Father, to<br/>
hear us, and, with thy Word and Holy Spirit, to bless and<br/>
sanctify these gifts of bread and wine, that they may be unto<br/>
us the Body and Blood of thy dearly-beloved Son Jesus<br/>
Christ.</p>

<p>And we earnestly desire thy fatherly goodness to accept this<br/>
our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving, whereby we offer<br/>
and present unto thee, O Lord, our selves, our souls and<br/>
bodies. Grant, we beseech thee, that all who partake of this<br/>
Holy Communion may worthily receive the most precious<br/>
Body and Blood of thy Son Jesus Christ, and be filled with<br/>
thy grace and heavenly benediction; and also that we and all<br/>
thy whole Church may be made one body with him, that he</p>

<p>may dwell in us, and we in him; through the same Jesus<br/>
Christ our Lord;</p>

<p>By whom, and with whom, and in whom, in the unity of the<br/>
Holy Ghost all honor and glory be unto thee, O Father<br/>
Almighty, world without end. <em>AMEN</em>.</p>

<p>And now, as our Savior Christ hath taught us, we are bold<br/>
to say,</p>
