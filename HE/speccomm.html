<i><font size="2">This form is intended for use with those who for reasonable cause
cannot <br>
be present at a public celebration of the Eucharist.<br>
<br>
When persons are unable to be present for extended periods, it is <br>
desirable that the priest arrange to celebrate the Eucharist with them <br>
from time to time on a regular basis, using either the Proper of the Day
or <br>
one of those appointed for Various Occasions. If it is necessary to
shorten <br>
the service, the priest may begin the celebration at the
Offertory, but it is <br>
desirable that a passage from the Gospel first be
read.<br>
<br>
At other times, or when desired, such persons may be communicated <br>
from
the reserved Sacrament, using the following form.<br>
<br>
It is desirable that fellow parishioners, relatives, and friends be
present, <br>
when possible, to communicate with them.<br>
<br>
<br>
<a name="Scriptures"></a>The Celebrant, whether priest or deacon, reads a passage of Scripture <br>
appropriate to the day or occasion, or else one of the following<br>
</font></i>
<br>
God so loved the world that he gave his only Son, that <br>
whoever believes in him should not perish, but have eternal <br>
life.&nbsp; <i>&nbsp;<font size="2">John 3:16</font></i><br>
<br>
Jesus said, &quot;I am the bread of life; whoever comes to me shall <br>
not hunger, and whoever believes in me shall never thirst.&quot; <br>
<i><font size="2">John 6:35</font></i></font></p>

</font>

<p><font face="Goudy Old Style">Jesus said, &quot;I am the living bread which came down from <br>
heaven; if anyone eats of this bread, he will live for ever; and <br>
the bread which I shall give for the life of the world is my <br>
flesh. For my flesh is food indeed, and my blood is drink <br>
indeed. Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood abides in <br>
me, and I in him.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i><font size="2">John 6:51, 55-56</font></i><br>
<br>
Jesus said, &quot;Abide in me, as I in you. As the branch cannot <br>
bear fruit by itself, unless it abides in the vine, neither can <br>
you, unless you abide in me. I am the vine, you are the <br>
branches. By this my Father is glorified, that you bear much <br>
fruit, and so prove to be my disciples. As the Father has loved <br>
me, so have I loved you; abide in my love.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i><font size="2">John 15:4-5a, 8-9</font></i><br>
<br>
<i><font size="2">After the Reading, the Celebrant may comment on it briefly.<br>
<br>
<a name="Collect"></a>Suitable prayers may be offered, concluding with the following or some <br>
other Collect</font></i><br>
<br>
Almighty Father, whose dear Son, on the night before he <br>
suffered, instituted the Sacrament of his Body and Blood: <br>
Mercifully grant that we may receive it thankfully in <br>
remembrance of Jesus Christ our Lord, who in these holy <br>
mysteries gives us a pledge of eternal life; and who lives and <br>
reigns for ever and ever. <i>&nbsp;Amen.</i><br>
<br>
<i><font size="2"><a name="Confession"></a>A Confession of Sin may follow. The following or some other form is <br>
used</font></i><br>
<br>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves. </font></p>
