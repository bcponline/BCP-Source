<h1>Communion under<br/>
Special Circumstances</h1>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<p class="rubric">This form is intended for use with those who for reasonable cause cannot<br/>
be present at a public celebration of the Eucharist.<br/>
<br/>
When persons are unable to be present for extended periods, it is<br/>
desirable that the priest arrange to celebrate the Eucharist with them<br/>
from time to time on a regular basis, using either the Proper of the Day or<br/>
one of those appointed for Various Occasions. If it is necessary to shorten<br/>
the service, the priest may begin the celebration at the Offertory, but it is<br/>
desirable that a passage from the Gospel first be read.<br/>
<br/>
At other times, or when desired, such persons may be communicated<br/>
from the reserved Sacrament, using the following form.<br/>
<br/>
It is desirable that fellow parishioners, relatives, and friends be present,<br/>
when possible, to communicate with them.</p>
<br/>

<p class="rubric" id="Scriptures">The Celebrant, whether priest or deacon, reads a passage of Scripture<br/>
appropriate to the day or occasion, or else one of the following</p>

<p>God so loved the world that he gave his only Son, that<br/>
whoever believes in him should not perish, but have eternal<br/>
life.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em class="small">John 3:16</em></p>

<p>Jesus said, &quot;I am the bread of life; whoever comes to me shall<br/>
not hunger, and whoever believes in me shall never thirst.&quot;<br/>
<em class="small">John 6:35</em></p>

<br/>
<br/>
<p class="leftfoot">396&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Communion</em></p>
<hr>
<br/>
<br/>

<p>Jesus said, &quot;I am the living bread which came down from<br/>
heaven; if anyone eats of this bread, he will live for ever; and<br/>
the bread which I shall give for the life of the world is my<br/>
flesh. For my flesh is food indeed, and my blood is drink<br/>
indeed. Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood abides in<br/>
me, and I in him.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em class="small">John 6:51, 55-56</em></p>

<p>Jesus said, &quot;Abide in me, as I in you. As the branch cannot<br/>
bear fruit by itself, unless it abides in the vine, neither can<br/>
you, unless you abide in me. I am the vine, you are the<br/>
branches. By this my Father is glorified, that you bear much<br/>
fruit, and so prove to be my disciples. As the Father has loved<br/>
me, so have I loved you; abide in my love.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em class="small">John 15:4-5a, 8-9</em></p>

<p class="rubric">After the Reading, the Celebrant may comment on it briefly.</p>

<p class="rubric" id="Collect">Suitable prayers may be offered, concluding with the following or some<br/>
other Collect</p>

<p>Almighty Father, whose dear Son, on the night before he<br/>
suffered, instituted the Sacrament of his Body and Blood:<br/>
Mercifully grant that we may receive it thankfully in<br/>
remembrance of Jesus Christ our Lord, who in these holy<br/>
mysteries gives us a pledge of eternal life; and who lives and<br/>
reigns for ever and ever. <em>Amen.</em></p>

<p class="rubric" id="Confession">A Confession of Sin may follow. The following or some other form is<br/>
used</p>

<p>Most merciful God,<br/>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br/>
in thought, word, and deed,<br/>
by what we have done,<br/>
and by what we have left undone.<br/>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br/>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves. </p>

eternal life. <em>Amen.</em></p>
