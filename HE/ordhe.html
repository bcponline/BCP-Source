</b>
<br>
Either here or elsewhere in the service, all greet one another in the <br>
name of the Lord.<br>
<br>
<b>Prepare the Table</b><br>
<br>
Some of those present prepare the table; the bread, the cup of wine, <br>
and other offerings, are placed upon it.<br>
<br>
<b>Make Eucharist</b><br>
<br>
The Great Thanksgiving is said by the Priest in the name of the <br>
gathering, using one of the eucharistic prayers provided.<br>
<br>
The people respond--Amen!<br>
<br>
<b>Break the Bread</b><br>
<br>
<b>Share the Gifts of God</b><br>
<br>
The Body and Blood of the Lord are shared in a reverent manner; after<br>
all have received, any of the Sacrament that remains is then consumed.<br>
<br>
<i><font size="2">When a common meal or Agape is a part of the celebration, it follows
here.</font></i></font></p>

Jesus Christ our Lord.<br>

The Prayer continues with these words</font></i><br>
<br>
And so, Father, we bring you these gifts. Sanctify them by <br>
your Holy Spirit to be for your people the Body and Blood <br>
of Jesus Christ our Lord.<br>

On the night he was betrayed he took bread, said the <br>
blessing, broke the bread, and gave it to his friends, and <br>
said, &quot;Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. <br>
Do this for the remembrance of me.&quot;<br>
<br>
After supper, he took the cup of wine, gave thanks, and <br>
said, &quot;Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new <br>
Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the <br>
forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the <br>
remembrance of me.&quot;<br>
<br>
Father, we now celebrate the memorial of your Son. By <br>
means of this holy bread and cup, we show forth the sacrifice <br>
of his death, and proclaim his resurrection, until he comes <br>
again.<br>
<br>
Gather us by this Holy Communion into one body in your <br>
Son Jesus Christ. Make us a living sacrifice of praise.<br>
<br>
By him, and with him, and in him, in the unity of the Holy <br>
Spirit all honor and glory is yours, Almighty Father, now and <br>
for ever. <i>AMEN.</i></p>

On the night he was handed over to suffering and death, our <br>
Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks <br>
to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, <br>
&quot;Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this <br>
for the remembrance of me.&quot;<br>

This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you <br>
and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink <br>
it, do this for the remembrance of me.&quot;<br>
<br>
Recalling now his suffering and death, and celebrating his <br>
resurrection and ascension, we await his coming in glory.<br>
<br>
Accept, O Lord, our sacrifice of praise, this memorial of our <br>
redemption.<br>
<br>
Send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts. Let them be for us <br>
the Body and Blood of your Son. And grant that we who eat <br>
this bread and drink this cup may be filled with your life and <br>
goodness.<br>
<br>
<i><font size="2">The Celebrant then prays that all may receive the benefits of Christ's <br>
work, and the renewal of the Holy Spirit.<br>
<br>
The Prayer concludes with these or similar words</font></i><br>
<br>
All this we ask through your Son Jesus Christ. By him, and <br>
with him, and in him, in the unity of the Holy Spirit all honor <br>
and glory is yours, Almighty Father, now and for ever. <i>AMEN.</i></font> </p>
