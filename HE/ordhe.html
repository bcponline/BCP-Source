<p>Father, we now celebrate the memorial of your Son. By<br/>
means of this holy bread and cup, we show forth the sacrifice<br/>
of his death, and proclaim his resurrection, until he comes<br/>
again.</p>

<p>Gather us by this Holy Communion into one body in your<br/>
Son Jesus Christ. Make us a living sacrifice of praise.</p>

<p>By him, and with him, and in him, in the unity of the Holy<br/>
Spirit all honor and glory is yours, Almighty Father, now and<br/>
for ever. <em>AMEN.</em></p>

<p>On the night he was handed over to suffering and death, our<br/>

<p>Recalling now his suffering and death, and celebrating his<br/>
resurrection and ascension, we await his coming in glory.</p>

<p>Accept, O Lord, our sacrifice of praise, this memorial of our<br/>
redemption.</p>

<p>Send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts. Let them be for us<br/>
the Body and Blood of your Son. And grant that we who eat<br/>
this bread and drink this cup may be filled with your life and<br/>
goodness.</p>

work, and the renewal of the Holy Spirit.</p>

with him, and in him, in the unity of the Holy Spirit all honor<br/>
