<p class="rubric">The Decalogue, <a href="decaloguet.html">page 317</a>, may be said, the people kneeling.<br/>
</p>

<p class="rubric">The Celebrant may read one of the following sentences</p>

<p>Hear what our Lord Jesus saith: <br/>
Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with<br/>
all thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is the first and great<br/>
commandment. And the second is like unto it: Thou shalt<br/>
love thy neighbor as thyself. On these two commandments<br/>
hang all the Law and the Prophets.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em class="small">Matthew 22:37-40</em></p>

<br/>
<br/>

<p>If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the<br/>
truth is not in us; but if we confess our sins, God is faithful<br/>
and just to forgive our sins, and cleanse us from all<br/>
unrighteousness.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em class="small">1 John 1:8,9</em></p>

<p>Seeing that we have a great high priest, that is passed into the<br/>
heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us come boldly unto the<br/>
throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to<br/>
help in time of need.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em class="small">Hebrews 4:14,16</em></p>

<br/>
<p class="rubric">The Deacon or Celebrant then says</p>

<p>Let us humbly confess our sins unto Almighty God.</p>

<p class="rubric">Silence may be kept</p>

<p class="rubric">Minister and People</p>

<p>Most merciful God, <br/>
we confess that we have sinned against thee<br/>
in thought, word, and deed,<br/>
by what we have done,<br/>
and by what we have left undone.<br/>
We have not loved thee with our whole heart;<br/>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br/>
We are truly sorry and we earnestly repent.<br/>
For the sake of thy Son Jesus Christ, <br/>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br/>
that we may delight in thy will,<br/>
and walk in thy ways,<br/>
to the glory of thy Name. Amen.</p>

<p class="rubric">or this</p>

<p>Almighty and most merciful father,<br/>
we have erred and strayed from thy ways like lost sheep,<br/>
we have followed too much the devices and desires of our<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;own hearts,</p>

<br/>
<br/>
<p class="leftfoot">320&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Penitential Order I</em></p>
<hr>
<br/>
<br/>

<p>we have offended against thy holy laws,<br/>
we have left undone those things which we ought to<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have done,<br/>
and we have done those things which we ought not to<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have done.<br/>
But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us,<br/>
spare thou those who confess their faults,<br/>
restore thou those who are penitent,<br/>
according to thy promises declared unto mankind<br/>
in Christ Jesus our Lord;<br/>
and grant, O most merciful Father, for his sake,<br/>
that we may hereafter live a godly, righteous, and sober life,<br/>
to the glory of thy holy Name. Amen.</p>

<p class="rubric">The Bishop when present, or the Priest, stands and says</p>

<p>The Almighty and merciful Lord grant you absolution and<br/>
remission of all your sins, true repentance, amendment of<br/>
life, and the grace and consolation of his Holy Spirit.<em> Amen.<br/>

<p class="rubric">A deacon or lay person using the preceding form substitutes &quot;us&quot; for<br/>
&quot;you&quot; and &quot;our&quot; for &quot;your.&quot;</p>

<p class="rubric">When this Order is used at the beginning of the Liturgy, the service<br/>
continues with the Kyrie eleison, the Trisagion, or the Gloria in excelsis.</p>

<p class="rubric">When used separately, it concludes with suitable prayers, and the Grace <br/>
or a blessing.</p>
