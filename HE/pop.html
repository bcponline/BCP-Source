O Lord our God, accept the fervent prayers of your people; in <br>
the multitude of your mercies, look with compassion upon us <br>
and all who turn to you for help; for you are gracious, O <br>
lover of souls, and to you we give glory, Father, Son, and <br>
Holy Spirit, now and for ever. <i>Amen.</i><br>

Lord Jesus Christ, you said to your apostles, &quot;Peace I give
to <br>
you; my own peace I leave with you:&quot; Regard not our sins, <br>
but the faith of your Church, and give to us the peace and <br>
unity of that heavenly City, where with the Father and the <br>
Holy Spirit you live and reign, now and for ever. <i>Amen.</i><br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
Hasten, O Father, the coming of thy kingdom; and grant that <br>
we thy servants, who now live by faith, may with joy behold <br>
thy Son at his coming in glorious majesty; even Jesus Christ, <br>
our only Mediator and Advocate. <i>Amen.</i><br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
Almighty God, by your Holy Spirit you have made us one <br>
with your saints in heaven and on earth: Grant that in our <br>
earthly pilgrimage we may always be supported by this <br>
fellowship of love and prayer, and know ourselves to be <br>
surrounded by their witness to your power and mercy. We <br>
ask this for the sake of Jesus Christ, in whom all our <br>
intercessions are acceptable through the Spirit, and who lives <br>
and reigns for ever and ever. <i>Amen.</i></font></p>
