<p>Again the Lord spoke to Ahaz, saying, Ask a sign of the Lord your<br/>
God; let it be deep as Sheol or high as heaven. But Ahaz said, I<br/>
will not ask, and I will not put the Lord to the test. Then Isaiah<br/>
said: “Hear then, O house of David! Is it too little for you to weary<br/>
mortals, that you weary my God also? Therefore the Lord himself<br/>
will give you a sign. Look, the young woman is with child and shall<br/>
bear a son, and shall name him Immanuel.”</p>

<br/>

<p><em>A Reading (Lesson) from the Letter to the Hebrews [10:4-10]</em></p>

<p>It is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins. <br/>
Consequently, when Christ came into the world, he said, “Sacrifices <br/>
and offerings you have not desired, but a body you have prepared <br/>
for me; in burnt offerings and sin offerings you have taken no <br/>
pleasure.  Then I said, ‘See, God, I have come to do your will, <br/>
O God’ (in the scroll of the book it is written of me).” When he said <br/>
above, “You have neither desired nor taken pleasure in sacrifices and <br/>
offerings and burnt offerings and sin offerings” (these are offered <br/>
according to the law), then he added, “See, I have come to do your <br/>
will.” He abolishes the first in order to establish the second. And it <br/>
is by God’s will that we have been sanctified through the offering of <br/>
the body of Jesus Christ once for all.</p>

<p>In the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent by God to a town <br/>
in Galilee called Nazareth, to a virgin engaged to a man whose <br/>
name was Joseph, of the house of David. The virgin’s name was <br/>
Mary. And he came to her and said, “Greetings, favored one! The <br/>
Lord is with you.” But she was much perplexed by his words and <br/>
pondered what sort of greeting this might be. The angel said to <br/>
her, “Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God. <br/>
And now, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you <br/>
will name him Jesus. He will be great, and will be called the Son <br/>
of the Most High, and the Lord God will give to him the throne of <br/>
his ancestor David. He will reign over the house of Jacob forever, <br/>
and of his kingdom there will be no end.” Mary said to the angel, <br/>
“How can this be, since I am a virgin?” The angel said to her, “The <br/>
Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High <br/>
will overshadow you; therefore the child to be born will be holy; <br/>
he will be called Son of God. And now, your relative Elizabeth in <br/>
her old age has also conceived a son; and this is the sixth month <br/>
for her who was said to be barren. For nothing will be impossible <br/>
with God.” Then Mary said, “Here am I, the servant of the Lord; <br/>
let it be with me according to your word.” Then the angel departed <br/>
from her.</p>
