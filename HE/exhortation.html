<p>Beloved in the Lord: Our Savior Christ, on the night before<br>
he suffered, instituted the Sacrament of his Body and<br>
Blood as a sign and pledge of his love, for the continual<br>
remembrance of the sacrifice of his death, and for a spiritual<br>
sharing in his risen life. For in these holy Mysteries we are<br>
made one with Christ, and Christ with us; we are made one<br>
body in him, and members one of another.</p>

<p>Having in mind, therefore, his great love for us, and in<br>
obedience to his command, his Church renders to Almighty<br>
God our heavenly Father never-ending thanks for the<br>
creation of the world, for his continual providence over us,<br>
for his love for all mankind, and for the redemption of the<br>
world by our Savior Christ, who took upon himself our flesh,<br>
and humbled himself even to death on the cross, that he<br>
might make us the children of God by the power of the Holy<br>
Spirit, and exalt us to everlasting life.</p>

<p>But if we are to share rightly in the celebration of those holy<br>
Mysteries, and be nourished by that spiritual Food, we must <br>
remember the dignity of that holy Sacrament. I therefore call <br>
upon you to consider how Saint Paul exhorts all persons to<br>
prepare themselves carefully before eating of that Bread and<br>
drinking of that Cup.</p>

<p>For, as the benefit is great, if with penitent hearts and living<br>
faith we receive the holy Sacrament, so is the danger great, if<br>
we receive it improperly, not recognizing the Lord&#146;s Body.<br>
Judge yourselves, therefore, lest you be judged by the Lord.</p>

<p>Examine your lives and conduct by the rule of God&#146;s<br>
commandments, that you may perceive wherein you have <br>
offended in what you have done or left undone, whether in<br>
thought, word, or deed. And acknowledge your sins before <br>
Almighty God, with full purpose of amendment of life, being<br>
ready to make restitution for all injuries and wrongs done by<br>
you to others; and also being ready to forgive those who have<br>
offended you, in order that you yourselves may be forgiven.<br>
And then, being reconciled with one another, come to the<br>
banquet of that most heavenly Food.</p>

<p>And if, in your preparation, you need help and counsel, then<br>
go and open your grief to a discreet and understanding priest,<br>
and confess your sins, that you may receive the benefit of<br>
absolution, and spiritual counsel and advice; to the removal<br>
of scruple and doubt, the assurance of pardon, and the<br>
strengthening of your faith.</p>

<p>To Christ our Lord who loves us, and washed us in his own<br>
blood, and made us a kingdom of priests to serve his God<br>
and Father, to him be glory in the Church evermore. Through<br>
him let us offer continually the sacrifice of praise, which is<br>
our bounden duty and service, and, with faith in him, come<br>
boldly before the throne of grace [and humbly confess our<br>
sins to Almighty God].</p>
