</p>

<p class="rubric">The Celebrant may read one of the following sentences</p>

<p>Jesus said, &quot;The first commandment is this: Hear, O Israel: <br/>
The Lord your God is the only Lord. Love the Lord your <br/>
God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your <br/>
mind, and with all your strength. The second is this: Love <br/>
your neighbor as yourself. There is no commandment <br/>
greater than these.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em class="small">Mark 12:29-31</em></p>

<p>If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the <br/>
truth is not in us. But if we confess our sins, God, who is <br/>
faithful and just, will forgive our sins and cleanse us from all <br/>
unrighteousness.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em class="small">1 John 1:8,9</em></p>

<p>Since we have a great high priest who has passed through the <br/>
heavens, Jesus, the Son of God, let us with confidence draw <br/>
near to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy and <br/>
find grace to help in time of need.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em class="small">Hebrews 4:14,16</em></p>
<br/>

<p class="rubric">The Deacon or Celebrant then says</p>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.</p>

<p class="rubric">Silence may be kept.</p>

<p class="rubric">Minister and People</p>

<p>Most merciful God,<br/>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br/>
in thought, word, and deed, <br/>
by what we have done,<br/>
and by what we have left undone.<br/>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br/>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves. <br/>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent. <br/>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br/>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br/>
that we may delight in your will,<br/>
and walk in your ways,<br/>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.</p>

<p class="rubric">The Bishop when present, or the Priest, stands and says</p>

<p>Almighty God have mercy on you, forgive you all your sins <br/>
through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen you in all <br/>
goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep you <br/>
in eternal life. <em>Amen.</em></p>
