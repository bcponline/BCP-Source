<p>O God the Father, Creator of heaven and earth,<br/>
<em>Have mercy upon us.</em> <br/>
<br/>
O God the Son, Redeemer of the world,<br/>
<em>Have mercy upon us.</em> <br/>
<br/>
O God the Holy Ghost, Sanctifier of the faithful,<br/>
<em>Have mercy upon us.</em> <br/>
<br/>
O holy, blessed, and glorious Trinity, one God,<br/>
<em>Have mercy upon us.</em> </p>

<p>Remember not, Lord Christ, our offenses, nor the offenses<br/>
of our forefathers; neither reward us according to our sins.<br/>
Spare us, good Lord, spare thy people, whom thou hast<br/>
redeemed with thy most precious blood, and by thy mercy<br/>
preserve us, for ever.<br/>
<em>Spare us, good Lord.</em> </p>

<p>From all evil and wickedness; from sin; from the crafts<br/>
and assaults of the devil; and from everlasting damnation,<br/>
<em>Good Lord, deliver us.</em> </p>

<p>From all blindness of heart; from pride, vainglory,<br/>
and hypocrisy; from envy, hatred, and malice; and from all want<br/>
of charity,<br/>

violence, battle, and murder; and from dying suddenly and <br/>
unprepared,<br/>
<em>Good Lord, deliver us.</em> </p>

<p>By the mystery of thy holy Incarnation; by thy holy Nativity<br/>
and submission to the Law; by thy Baptism, Fasting, and<br/>
Temptation,<br/>
<em>Good Lord, deliver us.</em> </p>

<p>By thine Agony and Bloody Sweat; by thy Cross and Passion;<br/>
by thy precious Death and Burial; by thy glorious Resurrection<br/>
and Ascension; and by the Coming of the Holy Ghost,<br/>
<em>Good Lord, deliver us.</em> </p>

<p>In all time of our tribulation; in all time of our prosperity; in<br/>
the hour of death, and in the day of judgment,<br/>
