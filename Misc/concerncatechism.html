<h2 class="concern">Concerning the Catechism</h2>

<br/>
<p class="small">This catechism is primarily intended for use by parish priests, deacons, <br/>
and lay catechists, to give an outline for instruction. It is a commentary <br/>
on the creeds, but is not meant to be a complete statement of belief and <br/>
practices; rather, it is a point of departure for the teacher, and it is cast in<br/>
the traditional question and answer form for ease of reference.</p>

<p class="small">The second use of this catechism is to provide a brief summary of the <br/>
Church's teaching for an inquiring stranger who picks up a Prayer Book.</p>

<p class="small">It may also be used to form a simple service; since the matter is arranged <br/>
under headings, it is suitable for selective use, and the leader may <br/>
introduce prayers and hymns as needed.</p>
