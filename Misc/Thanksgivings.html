Accept, O Lord, our thanks and praise for all that you have<br/>
done for us. We thank you for the splendor of the whole<br/>
creation, for the beauty of this world, for the wonder of life,<br/>
and for the mystery of love.<br/>
<br/>
We thank you for the blessing of family and friends, and for<br/>
the loving care which surrounds us on every side.<br/>
<br/>
We thank you for setting us at tasks which demand our best<br/>
efforts, and for leading us to accomplishments which satisfy<br/>
and delight us.<br/>
<br/>
We thank you also for those disappointments and failures<br/>
that lead us to acknowledge our dependence on you alone.<br/>
<br/>
Above all, we thank you for your Son Jesus Christ; for the<br/>
truth of his Word and the example of his life; for his steadfast<br/>
obedience, by which he overcame temptation; for his dying,<br/>
through which he overcame death; and for his rising to life<br/>
again, in which we are raised to the life of your kingdom.<br/>
<br/>
Grant us the gift of your Spirit, that we may know him and<br/>
make him known; and through him, at all times and in all<br/>
places, may give thanks to you in all things. <em>Amen.</em><br/>
