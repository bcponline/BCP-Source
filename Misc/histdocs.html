<p class="small">Therefore, following the holy fathers, we all with one accord teach men to acknowledge one <br/>
and the same Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, at once complete in Godhead and complete in <br/>
manhood, truly God and truly man, consisting also of a reasonable soul and body; of one <br/>
substance (homoousios) with the Father as regards his Godhead, and at the same time of <br/>
one substance with us as regards his manhood; like us in all respects, apart from sin; as <br/>
regards his Godhead, begotten of the Father before the ages, but yet as regards his manhood <br/>
begotten, for us men and for our salvation, of Mary the Virgin, the God-bearer<br/>
(Theotokos); one and the same Christ, Son, Lord, Only-begotten, recognized in two <br/>
natures, without confusion, without change, without division, without separation; the <br/>
distinction of natures being in no way annulled by the union, but rather the characteristics <br/>
of each nature being preserved and coming together to form one person and subsistence, <br/>
not as parted or separated into two persons, but one and the same Son and Only-begotten <br/>
God the Word, Lord Jesus Christ; even as the prophets from earliest times spoke of him, <br/>
and our Lord Jesus Christ himself taught us, and the creed of the Fathers has handed down <br/>
to us.<br/>

<p class="small">Whosoever will be saved, before all things it is necessary that he hold the Catholic Faith.<br/>
Which Faith except everyone do keep whole and undefiled, without doubt he shall perish <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; everlastingly.<br/>
And the Catholic Faith is this: That we worship one God in Trinity, and Trinity in Unity, <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; neither confounding the Persons, nor dividing the Substance.<br/>
For there is one Person of the Father, another of the Son, and another of the Holy Ghost.<br/>
But the Godhead of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, is all one, the Glory <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; equal, the Majesty co-eternal.<br/>
Such as the Father is, such is the Son, and such is the Holy Ghost.<br/>
The Father uncreate, the Son uncreate, and the Holy Ghost uncreate.<br/>
The Father incomprehensible, the Son incomprehensible, and the Holy Ghost <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; incomprehensible.<br/>
The Father eternal, the Son eternal, and the Holy Ghost eternal.<br/>
And yet they are not three eternals, but one eternal.<br/>
As also there are not three incomprehensibles, nor three uncreated, but one uncreated, and <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; one incomprehensible.<br/>
So likewise the Father is Almighty, the Son Almighty, and the Holy Ghost Almighty.<br/>
And yet they are not three Almighties, but one Almighty.</p>

<br/>

<p class="small">So the Father is God, the Son is God, and the Holy Ghost is God.<br/>
And yet they are not three Gods, but one God.<br/>
So likewise the Father is Lord, the Son Lord, and the Holy Ghost Lord.<br/>
And yet not three Lords, but one Lord.<br/>
For like as we are compelled by the Christian verity to acknowledge every Person by <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; himself to be both God and Lord,<br/>
So are we forbidden by the Catholic Religion, to say, There be three Gods, or three Lords.<br/>
The Father is made of none, neither created, nor begotten.<br/>
The Son is of the Father alone, not made, nor created, but begotten.<br/>
The Holy Ghost is of the Father and of the Son, neither made, nor created, nor begotten, <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but proceeding.<br/>
So there is one Father, not three Fathers; one Son, not three Sons; one Holy Ghost, not three <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Holy Ghosts.<br/>
And in this Trinity none is afore, or after other; none is greater, or less than another;<br/>
But the whole three Persons are co-eternal together and co-equal.<br/>
So that in all things, as is aforesaid, the Unity in Trinity and the Trinity in Unity is to be <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; worshipped.<br/>
He therefore that will be saved must think thus of the Trinity. <br/>
<br/>
Furthermore, it is necessary to everlasting salvation that he also believe rightly the <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ.<br/>
For the right Faith is, that we believe and confess, that our Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; God, is God and Man;<br/>
God, of the substance of the Father, begotten before the worlds; and Man of the substance <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of his Mother, born in the world;<br/>
Perfect God and perfect Man, of a reasonable soul and human flesh subsisting.<br/>
Equal to the Father, as touching his Godhead; and inferior to the Father, as touching his <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; manhood;<br/>
Who, although he be God and Man, yet he is not two, but one Christ;<br/>
One, not by conversion of the Godhead into flesh but by taking of the Manhood into God;<br/>
One altogether; not by confusion of Substance, but by unity of Person.<br/>
For as the reasonable soul and flesh is one man, so God and Man is one Christ;<br/>
Who suffered for our salvation, descended into hell, rose again the third day from the dead.<br/>
He ascended into heaven, he sitteth at the right hand of the Father, God Almighty, from <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; whence he will come to judge the quick and the 
dead.<br/>
At whose coming all men will rise again with their bodies and shall give account for their <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; own works.<br/>
And they that have done good shall go into life everlasting; and they that have done evil into <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; everlasting fire.<br/>
This is the Catholic Faith, which except a man believe faithfully, he cannot be saved.</p>

<p><strong><a name="1stBCPPreface">Preface</a><br/>
<br/>
The First Book of Common Prayer (1549)</strong></p>

<p class="small">There was never any thing by the wit of man so well devised, or so sure established, which <br/>
in continuance of time hath not been corrupted: as, among other things, it may plainly <br/>
appear by the common prayers in the Church, commonly called Divine Service: the first <br/>
original and ground whereof, if a man would search out by the ancient fathers, he shall find, <br/>
that the same was not ordained, but of a good purpose, and for a great advancement of <br/>
godliness: For they so ordered the matter, that all the whole Bible (or the greatest part <br/>
thereof) should be read over once in the year, intending thereby, that the Clergy, and <br/>
especially such as were Ministers of the congregation, should (by often reading, and <br/>
meditation of God's word) be stirred up to godliness themselves, and be more able to exhort <br/>
others by wholesome doctrine, and to confute them that were adversaries to the truth. And <br/>
further, that the people (by daily hearing of holy Scripture read in the Church) should <br/>
continually profit more and more in the knowledge of God, and be the more inflamed with <br/>
the love of his true religion.<br/>
<br/>
But these many years passed, this godly and decent order of the ancient fathers hath been so <br/>
altered, broken, and neglected, by planting in uncertain stories, Legends, Responds, Verses, <br/>
vain repetitions, Commemorations, and Synodals, that commonly when any book of the <br/>
Bible was begun, before three or four Chapters were read out, all the rest were unread. And <br/>
in this sort the book of Isaiah was begun in Advent, and the book of Genesis in<br/>
Septuagesima; but they were only begun, and never read through. After a like sort were <br/>
other books of holy Scripture used. And moreover, whereas St. Paul would have such <br/>
language spoken to the people in the Church, as they might understand, and have profit by <br/>
hearing the same, the Service in the Church of England (these many years) hath been read in <br/>
Latin to the people, which they understood not; so that they have heard with their ears <br/>
only; and their hearts, spirit, and mind, have not been edified thereby. And furthermore, <br/>
notwithstanding that the ancient fathers had divided the Psalms into seven portions, <br/>
whereof every one was called a nocturn, now of late time a few of them have been daily said <br/>
(and oft repeated), and the rest utterly omitted. Moreover, the number and hardness of the <br/>
Rules called the Pie, and the manifold changings of the service, was the cause, that to turn <br/>
the Book only, was so hard and intricate a matter, that many times, there was more business <br/>
to find out what should be read, than to read it when it was found out.<br/>
<br/>
These inconveniences therefore considered, here is set forth such an order, whereby the <br/>
same shall be redressed. And for a readiness in this matter, here is drawn out a Kalendar for <br/>
that purpose, which is plain and easy to be understood, wherein (so much as may be) the <br/>
reading of holy Scripture is so set forth, that all things shall be done in order, without <br/>
breaking one piece thereof from another. For this cause be cut off Anthems, Responds, <br/>
Invitatories, and such like things, as did break the continual course of the reading of the <br/>
Scripture.<br/>
<br/>
Yet because there is no remedy, but that of necessity there must be some rules: therefore <br/>
certain rules are here set forth, which, as they be few in number; so they be plain and easy to <br/>
be understood. So that here you have an order for prayer (as touching the reading of the <br/>
holy Scripture), much agreeable to the mind and purpose of the old fathers, and a great deal <br/>
more profitable and commodious, than that which of late was used. It is more profitable, <br/>
because here are left out many things, whereof some be untrue, some uncertain, some vain</p>

<br/>
<br/>
<p class="leftfoot">866&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Historical Documents</em></p>
<hr>
<br/>
<br/>

<p class="small">and superstitious: and is ordained nothing to be read, but the very pure word of God, the <br/>
holy Scriptures, or that which is evidently grounded upon the same; and that in such a <br/>
language and order as is most easy and plain for the understanding, both of the readers and <br/>
hearers. It is also more commodious, both for the shortness thereof, and for the plainness of <br/>
the order, and for that the rules be few and easy. Furthermore, by this order the curates shall <br/>
need none other books for their public service, but this book and the Bible: by the means <br/>
whereof, the people shall not be at so great charge for books, as in time past they have been.<br/>
<br/>
And where heretofore, there hath been great diversity in saying and singing in churches <br/>
within this realm: some following Salisbury use, some Hereford use, some the use of <br/>
Bangor, some of York, and some of Lincoln: now from henceforth, all the whole realm shall <br/>
have but one use. And if any would judge this way more painful, because that all things <br/>
must be read upon the book, whereas before, by reason of so often repetition, they could <br/>
say many things by heart: if those men will weigh their labor with the profit in knowledge, <br/>
which daily they shall obtain by reading upon the book, they will not refuse the pain, in <br/>
consideration of the great profit that shall ensue thereof.<br/>
<br/>
And forasmuch as nothing else, almost, be so plainly set forth, but doubts may arise in the <br/>
use and practicing of the same: to appease all such diversity (if any arise), and for the <br/>
resolution of all doubts, concerning the manner how to understand, do, and execute, the <br/>
things contained in this book: the parties that so doubt, or diversely take any thing, shall <br/>
always resort to the Bishop of the Diocese, who by his discretion shall take order for the <br/>
quieting and appeasing of the same; so that the same order be not contrary to any thing <br/>
contained in this book.<br/>
<br/>
Though it be appointed in the afore written preface, that all things shall be read and sung in <br/>
the church in the English tongue, to the end that the congregation may be thereby edified: <br/>
yet it is not meant, but when men say Matins and Evensong privately, they may say the <br/>
same in any language that they themselves do understand. Neither that any man shall be <br/>
bound to the saying of them, but such as from time to time, in Cathedral and Collegiate <br/>
Churches, parish Churches, and Chapels to the same annexed, shall serve the congregation.<br/>

The Old Testament is not contrary to the New: for both in the Old and New Testament<br/>
everlasting life is offered to Mankind by Christ, who is the only Mediator between God and <br/>
Man, being both God and Man. Wherefore they are not to be heard, which feign that the <br/>
old Fathers did look only for transitory promises. Although the Law given from God by <br/>
Moses, as touching Ceremonies and Rites, do not bind Christian men, nor the Civil precepts <br/>
thereof ought of necessity to be received in any commonwealth; yet notwithstanding, no <br/>
Christian man whatsoever is free from the obedience of the Commandments which are <br/>
called Moral.</p>

<p class="articlehead">VIII. Of the Creeds.</p>

<p class="small">The Nicene Creed, and that which is commonly called the Apostles' Creed, ought<br/>
thoroughly to be received and believed: for they may be proved by most certain warrants of <br/>
Holy Scripture.<br/>
<br/>
<em>The original Article given Royal assent in 1571 and reaffirmed in 1662, was entitled, &quot;Of <br/>
the Three Creeds; and began as follows, &quot;The Three Creeds, Nicene Creed, Athanasius's <br/>
Creed, and that which is commonly called the Apostles' Creed . . .&quot;</em></p>

<p class="articlehead">IX. Of Original or Birth Sin.</p>

<p class="small">Original sin standeth not in the following of Adam, (as the Pelagians do vainly talk;) but it <br/>
is the fault and corruption of the Nature of every man, that naturally is engendered of the <br/>
offspring of Adam; whereby man is very far gone from original righteousness, and is of his <br/>
own nature inclined to evil, so that the flesh lusteth always contrary to the Spirit; and <br/>
therefore in every person born into this world, it deserveth God's wrath and damnation. <br/>
And this infection of nature doth remain, yea in them that are regenerated; whereby the lust <br/>
of the flesh, called in Greek, <em><font face="sans-serif">&#934;&#961;&#972;&#957;&#951;&#956;&#945; &#963;&#945;&#961;&#954;&#972;&#962;</font></em>, (which some do expound the wisdom, some <br/>
sensuality, some the affection, some the desire, of the flesh), is not subject to the Law of <br/>
God. And although there is no condemnation for them that believe and are baptized; yet the <br/>
Apostle doth confess, that concupiscence and lust hath of itself the nature of sin.</p>

<p class="articlehead">X. Of Free Will.</p>

<p class="small">The condition of Man after the fall of Adam is such, that he cannot turn and prepare <br/>
himself, by his own natural strength and good works, to faith, and calling upon God. <br/>
Wherefore we have no power to do good works pleasant and acceptable to God, without <br/>
the grace of God by Christ preventing us, that we may have a good will, and working with <br/>
us, when we have that good will.</p>

<p class="articlehead">XI. Of the Justification of Man.</p>

<p class="small">We are accounted righteous before God, only for the merit of our Lord and Saviour Jesus <br/>
Christ by Faith, and not for our own works or deservings. Wherefore, that we are justified <br/>
by Faith only, is a most wholesome Doctrine, and very full of comfort, as more largely is <br/>
expressed in the Homily of Justification.</p>

<p class="articlehead">XII. Of Good Works.</p>

<p class="small">Albeit that Good Works, which are the fruits of Faith, and follow after Justification, cannot <br/>
put away our sins, and endure the severity of God's judgment; yet are they pleasing and <br/>
acceptable to God in Christ, and do spring out necessarily of a true and lively Faith; <br/>
insomuch that by them a lively Faith may be as evidently known as a tree discerned by the <br/>
fruit.</p>

<p class="articlehead">XIII. Of Works before Justification.</p>

<p class="small">Works done before the grace of Christ, and the Inspiration of the Spirit, are not pleasant to <br/>
God, forasmuch as they spring not of faith in Jesus Christ; neither do they make men meet <br/>
to receive grace, or (as the School-authors say) deserve grace of congruity: yea rather, for <br/>
that they are not done as God hath willed and commanded them to be done, we doubt not <br/>
but they have the nature of sin.</p>

<p class="articlehead">XIV. Of Works of Supererogation.</p>

<p class="small">Voluntary Works besides, over and above, God's Commandments, which they call Works of <br/>
Supererogation, cannot be taught without arrogancy and impiety: for by them men do <br/>
declare, that they not only render unto God as much as they are bound to, but that <br/>
they do more for his sake, than of bounden duty is required: whereas Christ saith plainly, <br/>
When ye have done all that are commanded to you, say, We are unprofitable servants.</p>

<p class="articlehead">XV. Of Christ alone without Sin.</p>

<p class="small">Christ in the truth of our nature was made like unto us in all things, sin only except, from <br/>
which he was clearly void, both in his flesh, and in his spirit. He came to be the Lamb <br/>
without spot, who, by sacrifice of himself once made, should take away the sins of the <br/>
world; and sin (as Saint John saith) was not in him. But all we the rest, although baptized, <br/>
and born again in Christ, yet offend in many things; and if we say we have no sin, we <br/>
deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.</p>

<p class="articlehead">XVI. Of Sin after Baptism.</p>

<p class="small">Not every deadly sin willingly committed after Baptism is sin against the Holy Ghost, and <br/>
unpardonable. Wherefore the grant of repentance is not be denied to such as fall into sin <br/>
after Baptism. After we have received the Holy Ghost, we may depart from grace given, and <br/>
fall into sin, and by the grace of God we may arise again, and amend our lives. And <br/>
therefore they are to be condemned, which say, they can no more sin as long as they live <br/>
here, or deny the place of forgiveness to such as truly repent.</p>

<p class="articlehead">XVII. Of Predestination and Election.</p>

<p class="small">Predestination to Life is the everlasting purpose of God, whereby (before the foundations of <br/>
the world were laid) he hath constantly decreed by his counsel secret to us, to deliver from <br/>
curse and damnation those whom he hath chosen in Christ out of mankind, and to bring <br/>
them by Christ to everlasting salvation, as vessels made to honour. Wherefore, they which <br/>
be endued with so excellent a benefit of God, be called according to God's purpose by his <br/>
Spirit working in due season: they through Grace obey the calling: they be justified freely: <br/>
they be made sons of God by adoption: they be made like the image of his only-begotten <br/>
Son Jesus Christ: they walk religiously in good works, and at length, by God's mercy, they <br/>
attain to everlasting felicity.<br/>
<br/>
As the godly consideration of Predestination, and our Election in Christ, is full of sweet, <br/>
pleasant, and unspeakable comfort to godly persons, and such as feel in themselves the <br/>
working of the Spirit of Christ, mortifying the works of the flesh, and their earthly mem-<br/>
bers, and drawing up their mind to high and heavenly things, as well because it doth greatly <br/>
establish and confirm their faith of eternal Salvation to be enjoyed through Christ, as <br/>
because it doth fervently kindle their love towards God: So, for curious and carnal persons, <br/>
lacking the Spirit of Christ, to have continually before their eyes the sentence of God's <br/>
Predestination, is a most dangerous downfall, whereby the Devil doth thrust them either <br/>
into desperation, or into wrethchlessness of most unclean living, no less perilous than <br/>
desperation.<br/>
<br/>
Furthermore, we must receive God's promises in such wise, as they be generally set forth to <br/>
us in Holy Scripture: and, in our doings, that Will of God is to be followed, which we <br/>
have expressly declared unto us in the word of God.</p>

<p class="articlehead">XVIII. Of obtaining eternal Salvation only by the Name of Christ.</p>

<p class="small">They also are to be had accursed that presume to say, That every man shall be saved by the <br/>
Law or Sect which he professeth, so that he be diligent to frame his life according to that <br/>
Law, and the light of Nature. For Holy Scripture doth set out unto us only the Name of <br/>
Jesus Christ, whereby men must be saved.</p>

<p class="articlehead">XIX. Of the Church.</p>

<p class="small">The visible Church of Christ is a congregation of faithful men, in which the pure Word of <br/>
God is preached, and the Sacraments be duly ministered according to Christ's ordinance, in <br/>
all those things that of necessity are requisite to the same.<br/>
<br/>
As the Church of Jerusalem, Alexandria, and Antioch, have erred; so also the Church of <br/>
Rome hath erred, not only in their living and manner of Ceremonies, but also in matters of <br/>
Faith.</p>

<p class="articlehead">XX. Of the Authority of the Church.</p>

<p class="small">The Church hath power to decree Rites or Ceremonies, and authority in Controversies of <br/>
Faith: and yet it is not lawful for the Church to ordain anything that is contrary to God's <br/>
Word written, neither may it so expound one place of Scripture, that it be repugnant to <br/>
another.&nbsp; Wherefore, although the Church be a witness and a keeper of Holy Writ, yet, as it <br/>
ought not to decree any thing against the same, so besides the same ought not to enforce <br/>
any thing to be believed for necessity of Salvation.</p>

<p class="rubric">The original 1571, 1662 text of this Article, omitted in the version of 1801, reads as <br/>
follows: &quot;General Councils may not be gathered together without the commandment and <br/>
will of Princes. And when they be gathered together, (forasmuch as they be an assembly of <br/>
men, whereof all be not governed with the Spirit and Word of God,) they may err, and <br/>
sometimes have erred, even in things pertaining unto God. Wherefore things ordained by <br/>
them as necessary to salvation have neither strength nor authority, unless it may be declared <br/>

<p class="articlehead">XXII. Of Purgatory.</p>

<p class="small">The Romish Doctrine concerning Purgatory, Pardons, Worshipping and Adoration, as well <br/>

grounded upon no warranty of Scripture, but rather repugnant to the Word of God.</p>

<p class="articlehead">XXIII. Of Ministering in the Congregation.</p>

<p class="small">It is not lawful for any man to take upon him the office of public preaching, or ministering <br/>
the Sacraments in the Congregation, before he be lawfully called, and sent to execute the <br/>
same. And those we ought to judge lawfully called and sent, which be chosen and called to <br/>
this work by men who have public authority given unto them in the Congregation, to call <br/>
and send Ministers into the Lord's vineyard.</p>

<p class="articlehead">XXIV. Of Speaking in the Congregation in such a Tongue as the people understandeth.</p>

<p class="small">It is a thing plainly repugnant to the Word of God, and the custom of the Primitive Church, <br/>
to have public Prayer in the Church, or to minister the Sacraments, in a tongue not <br/>
understanded of the people.</p>

<p class="articlehead">XXV. Of the Sacraments.</p>

<p class="small">Sacraments ordained of Christ be not only badges or tokens of Christian men's profession, <br/>
but rather they be certain sure witnesses, and effectual signs of grace, and God's good will <br/>
towards us, by the which he doth work invisibly in us, and doth not only quicken, but also <br/>
strengthen and confirm our Faith in him.<br/>
<br/>
There are two Sacraments ordained of Christ our Lord in the Gospel, that is to say, <br/>
Baptism, and the Supper of the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
Those five commonly called Sacraments, that is to say, Confirmation, Penance, Orders, <br/>
Matrimony, and Extreme Unction, are not to be counted for Sacraments of the Gospel, <br/>
being such as have grown partly of the corrupt following of the Apostles, partly are states of <br/>
life allowed in the Scriptures; but yet have not like nature of Sacraments with Baptism, and <br/>
the Lord's Supper, for that they have not any visible sign or ceremony ordained of God.<br/>
<br/>
The Sacraments are not ordained of Christ to be gazed upon, or to be carried about, but <br/>
that we should duly use them. And in such only as worthily receive the same, they have a <br/>
wholesome effect or operation: but they that receive them unworthily, purchase to <br/>
themselves damnation, as Saint Paul saith.</p>

<br/>

<p class="articlehead">XXVI. Of the Unworthiness of the Ministers, which hinders not the effect of the Sacraments.</p>

<p class="small">Although in the visible Church the evil be ever mingled with the good, and sometimes the <br/>
evil have chief authority in the Ministration of the Word and Sacraments, yet forasmuch as <br/>
they do not the same in their own name, but in Christ's, and do minister by his commission <br/>
and authority, we may use their Ministry, both in hearing the Word of God, and in receiving <br/>
the Sacraments. Neither is the effect of Christ's ordinance taken away by their wickedness, <br/>
nor the grace of God's gifts diminished from such as by faith, and rightly, do receive the <br/>
Sacraments ministered unto them; which be effectual, because of Christ's institution and <br/>
promise, although they be ministered by evil men.<br/>
<br/>
Nevertheless, it appertaineth to the discipline of the Church, that inquiry be made of evil <br/>
Ministers, and that they be accused by those that have knowledge of their offences; and <br/>
finally, being found guilty, by just judgment be deposed.</p>

<p class="articlehead">XVII. Of Baptism.</p>

<p class="small">Baptism is not only a sign of profession, and mark of difference, whereby Christian men are <br/>
discerned from others that be not christened, but it is also a sign of Regeneration or <br/>
New-Birth, whereby, as by an instrument, they that receive Baptism rightly are grafted into <br/>
the Church; the promises of the forgiveness of sin, and of our adoption to be the sons of <br/>
God by the Holy Ghost, are visibly signed and sealed; Faith is confirmed, and Grace <br/>
increased by virtue of prayer unto God.<br/>
<br/>
The Baptism of young Children is in any wise to be retained in the Church, as most <br/>
agreeable with the institution of Christ.</p>

<p class="articlehead">XVIII. Of the Lord's Supper.</p>

<p class="small">The Supper of the Lord is not only a sign of the love that Christians ought to have among <br/>
themselves one to another; but rather it is a Sacrament of our Redemption by Christ's <br/>
death: insomuch that to such as rightly, worthily, and with faith, receive the same, the Bread <br/>
which we break is a partaking of the Body of Christ; and likewise the Cup of Blessing is a <br/>
partaking of the Blood of Christ.<br/>
<br/>
Transubstantiation (or the change of the substance of Bread and Wine) in the Supper of the <br/>
Lord, cannot be proved by Holy Writ; but is repugnant to the plain words of Scripture, <br/>
overthroweth the nature of a Sacrament, and hath given occasion to many superstitions.<br/>
<br/>
The Body of Christ is given, taken, and eaten, in the Supper, only after an heavenly and <br/>
spiritual manner. And the mean whereby the Body of Christ is received and eaten in the <br/>
Supper, is Faith.<br/>
<br/>
The Sacrament of the Lord's Supper was not by Christ's ordinance reserved, carried about, <br/>
lifted up, or worshipped.</p>

<p class="articlehead">XXIX. Of the Wicked, which eat not the Body of Christ in the use of the Lord's Supper.</p>

<p class="small">The Wicked, and such as be void of a lively faith, although they do carnally and visibly press <br/>
with their teeth (as Saint Augustine saith) the Sacrament of the Body and Blood of Christ; <br/>
yet in no wise are they partakers of Christ: but rather, to their condemnation, do eat and <br/>
drink the sign or Sacrament of so great a thing.</p>

<p class="small">The Cup of the Lord is not to be denied to the Lay-people: for both the parts of the Lord's <br/>

Christian men alike.</p>

<p class="articlehead">XXXI. Of the one Oblation of Christ finished upon the Cross.</p>

<p class="small">The Offering of Christ once made in that perfect redemption, propitiation, and satisfaction, <br/>
for all the sins of the whole world, both original and actual; and there is none other <br/>
satisfaction for sin, but that alone. Wherefore the sacrifices of Masses, in the which it was <br/>
commonly said, that the Priest did offer Christ for the quick and the dead, to have remission <br/>
of pain or guilt, were blasphemous fables, and dangerous deceits. </p>

<p class="articlehead">XXXII. Of the Marriage of Priests.</p>

<p class="small">Bishops, Priests, and Deacons, are not commanded by God's Law, either to vow the estate <br/>
of single life, or to abstain from marriage: therefore it is lawful for them, as for all other <br/>
Christian men, to marry at their own discretion, as they shall judge the same to serve better <br/>
to godliness.</p>

<p class="articlehead">XXXIII. Of excommunicate Persons, how they are to be avoided.</p>

<p class="small">That person which by open denunciation of the Church is rightly cut off from the unity of <br/>
the Church, and excommunicated, ought to be taken of the whole multitude of the faithful, <br/>
as an Heathen and Publican, until he be openly reconciled by penance, and received into the <br/>
Church by a Judge that hath the authority thereunto.</p>

<p class="articlehead">XXXIV. Of the Traditions of the Church.</p>

<p class="small">It is not necessary that the Traditions and Ceremonies be in all places one, or utterly like; for at <br/>
all times they have been divers, and may be changed according to the diversity of countries, <br/>
times, and men's manners, so that nothing be ordained against God's Word. Whosoever, <br/>
through his private judgment, willingly and purposely, doth openly break the Traditions <br/>
and Ceremonies of the Church, which be not repugnant to the Word of God, and be<br/>
ordained and approved by common authority, ought to be rebuked openly, (that others may <br/>
fear to do the like,) as he that offendeth against the common order of the Church, and <br/>
hurteth the authority of the Magistrate, and woundeth the consciences of the weak <br/>
brethren.<br/>
<br/>
Every particular or national Church hath authority to ordain, change, and abolish, <br/>
Ceremonies or Rites of the Church ordained only by man's authority, so that all things be <br/>
done to edifying.</p>

former Book of Homilies, which were set forth in the time of Edward the Sixth; and <br/>
therefore we judge them to be read in Churches by the Ministers, diligently and distinctly, <br/>
that they may be understanded of the people.</p>

assembled as Bishops in the Church of God, do hereby solemnly declare to all whom it may <br/>
concern, and especially to our fellow-Christians of the different Communions in this land, <br/>
who, in their several spheres, have contended for the religion of Christ:<br/>
<br/>
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our earnest desire that the Savior's prayer, &quot;That we all may be one,&quot; may, in its <br/>
deepest and truest sense, be speedily fulfilled;<br/>
<br/>
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That we believe that all who have been duly baptized with water, in the name of the <br/>
Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, are members of the Holy Catholic Church.<br/>
<br/>
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That in all things of human ordering or human choice, relating to modes of worship <br/>
and discipline, or to traditional customs, this Church is ready in the spirit of love and <br/>
humility to forego all preferences of her own;</p>

<br/>
<br/>

<p class="small">4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That this Church does not seek to absorb other Communions, but rather, co-operating <br/>
with them on the basis of a common Faith and Order, to discountenance schism, to heal the <br/>
wounds of the Body of Christ, and to promote the charity which is the chief of Christian <br/>
graces and the visible manifestation of Christ to the world.<br/>
<br/>
But furthermore, we do hereby affirm that the Christian unity . . .can be restored only by <br/>
the return of all Christian communions to the principles of unity exemplified by the <br/>
undivided Catholic Church during the first ages of its existence; which principles we believe <br/>
to be the substantial deposit of Christian Faith and Order committed by Christ and his <br/>
Apostles to the Church unto the end of the world, and therefore incapable of compromise <br/>
or surrender by those who have been ordained to be its stewards and trustees for the <br/>
common and equal benefit of all men.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As inherent parts of this sacred deposit, and therefore as essential to the restoration of unity <br/>
among the divided branches of Christendom, we account the following, to wit:<br/>
<br/>
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Holy Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments as the revealed Word of God.<br/>
<br/>
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Nicene Creed as the sufficient statement of the Christian Faith.<br/>
<br/>
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The two Sacraments,--Baptism and the Supper of the Lord,--ministered with <br/>
unfailing use of Christ's words of institution and of the elements ordained by Him.<br/>
<br/>
4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Historic Episcopate, locally adapted in the methods of its administration to the <br/>
varying needs of the nations and peoples called of God into the unity of His Church.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<em>Furthermore</em>, Deeply grieved by the sad divisions which affect the Christian Church in <br/>
our own land, we hereby declare our desire and readiness, so soon as there shall be any <br/>
authorized response to this Declaration, to enter into brotherly conference with all or any <br/>
Christian Bodies seeking the restoration of the organic unity of the Church, with a view to <br/>
the earnest study of the conditions under which so priceless a blessing might happily be <br/>
brought to pass.<br/>
