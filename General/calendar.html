<h1>The Calendar<br/>
of the Church Year</h1>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<p class="small">The Church Year consists of two cycles of feasts and holy days: one is<br/>
dependent upon the movable date of the Sunday of the Resurrection or<br/>
Easter Day; the other, upon the fixed date of December 25, the Feast of<br/>
our Lord's Nativity or Christmas Day.</p>

<p class="small">Easter Day is always the first Sunday after the full moon that falls on or<br/>
after March 21. It cannot occur before March 22 or after April 25.</p>

<p class="small">The sequence of all Sundays of the Church Year depends upon the date of<br/>
Easter Day. But the Sundays of Advent are always the four Sundays<br/>
before Christmas Day, whether it occurs on a Sunday or a weekday. The<br/>
date of Easter also determines the beginning of Lent on Ash Wednesday,<br/>
and the feast of the Ascension on a Thursday forty days after Easter Day.</p>


<p class="small"><strong>1. Principal Feasts</strong></p>

<p class="small">The Principal Feasts observed in this Church are the following:</p>

<table class="caltable">
    <tr>
        <td>Easter Day</td>
        <td>All Saints' Day, <em>November 1</em></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Ascension Day</td>
        <td>Christmas Day, <em>December 25</em></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>The Day of Pentecost</td>
        <td>The Epiphany, <em>January 6</em></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Trinity Sunday</td>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p class="small">These feasts take precedence of any other day or observance.  All Saints'<br/>
Day may always be observed on the Sunday following November 1, in<br/>
addition to its observance on the fixed date.</p>

<br/>
<br/>
<p class="rightfoot"><em>Calendar</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15</p>
<hr/>
<br/>
<br/>

<p class="small"><strong>2. Sundays</strong></p>

<p class="small">All Sundays of the year are feasts of our Lord Jesus Christ. In addition to<br/>
the dated days listed above, only the following feasts, appointed on fixed<br/>
days, take precedence of a Sunday:</p>

<p class="small">The Holy Name<br/>
The Presentation<br/>
The Transfiguration</p>

<p class="small">The feast of the Dedication of a Church, and the feast of its patron or<br/>
title, may be observed on, or be transferred to, a Sunday, except in the<br/>
seasons of Advent, Lent, and Easter.</p>

<p class="small">All other Feasts of our Lord, and all other Major Feasts appointed on<br/>
fixed days in the Calendar, when they occur on a Sunday, are normally<br/>
transferred to the first convenient open day within the week.  When<br/>
desired, however, the Collect, Preface, and one or more of the Lessons<br/>
appointed for the Feast may be substituted for those of the Sunday, but<br/>
not from the Last Sunday after Pentecost through the First Sunday after<br/>
the Epiphany, or from the Last Sunday after the Epiphany through<br/>
Trinity Sunday.</p>

<p class="small">With the express permission of the bishop, and for urgent and sufficient<br/>
reason, some other special occasion may be observed on a Sunday.</p>

<p class="small"><strong>3. Holy Days</strong></p>

<p class="small">The following Holy Days are regularly observed throughout the year.<br/>
Unless otherwise ordered in the preceding rules concerning Sundays, they<br/>
have precedence over all other days of commemoration or of special<br/>
observance:</p>
