<h1>Preface</h1>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<p class="small">It is a most invaluable part of that blessed &quot;liberty wherewith Christ<br/>
hath made us free,&quot; that in his worship different forms and usages may<br/>
without offense be allowed, provided the substance of the Faith be kept<br/>
entire; and that, in every Church, what cannot be clearly determined to<br/>
belong to Doctrine must be referred to Discipline; and therefore, by<br/>
common consent and authority, may be altered, abridged, enlarged,<br/>
amended, or otherwise disposed of, as may seem most convenient for the<br/>
edification of the people, &quot;according to the various exigency of times and<br/>
occasions.&quot;</p>

<p class="small">The Church of England, to which the Protestant Episcopal Church in<br/>
these States is indebted, under God, for her first foundation and a long<br/>
continuance of nursing care and protection, hath, in the Preface of her<br/>
Book of Common Prayer, laid it down as a rule, that &quot;The particular<br/>
Forms of Divine Worship, and the Rites and Ceremonies appointed to be<br/>
used therein, being things in their own nature indifferent, and alterable,<br/>
and so acknowledged; it is but reasonable that upon weighty and<br/>
important considerations, according to the various exigency of times and<br/>
occasions, such changes and alterations should be made therein, as to<br/>
those that are in place of Authority should, from time to time, seem either<br/>
necessary or expedient.&quot;</p>

<p class="small">The same Church hath not only in her Preface, but likewise in her Articles<br/>
and Homilies, declared the necessity and expediency of occasional<br/>
alterations and amendments in her Forms of Public Worship; and we find<br/>
accordingly, that, seeking to keep the happy mean between too much<br/>
stiffness in refusing, and too much easiness in admitting variations in</p>

<br/>
<br/>
<p class="rightfoot"><em>Preface</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9</p>

<p class="small">things once advisedly established, she hath, in the reign of several Princes,<br/>
since the first compiling of her Liturgy in the time of Edward the Sixth,<br/>
upon just and weighty considerations her thereunto moving, yielded to<br/>
make such alterations in some particulars, as in their respective times<br/>
were thought convenient; yet so as that the main body and essential parts<br/>
of the same (as well in the chiefest materials, as in the frame and order<br/>
thereof) have still been continued firm and unshaken.</p>

<p class="small">Her general aim in these different reviews and alterations hath been, as<br/>
she further declares in her said Preface, to do that which, according to her<br/>
best understanding, might most tend to the preservation of peace and<br/>
unity in the Church; the procuring of reverence, and the exciting of piety<br/>
and devotion in the worship of God; and, finally, the cutting off occasion,<br/>
from them that seek occasion, of cavil or quarrel against her Liturgy. And<br/>
although, according to her judgment, there be not any thing in it contrary<br/>
to the Word of God, or to sound doctrine, or which a godly man may not<br/>
with a good conscience use and submit unto, or which is not fairly<br/>
defensible, if allowed such just and favourable construction as in<br/>
common equity ought to be allowed to all human writings; yet upon the<br/>
principles already laid down, it cannot but be supposed that further<br/>
alterations would be found expedient. Accordingly, a Commission<br/>
for a review was issued in the year 1689: but this great and good work<br/>
miscarried at that time; and the Civil Authority has not since thought<br/>
proper to revive it by any new Commission.</p>

<p class="small">But when in the course of Divine Providence, these American States<br/>
became independent with respect to civil government, their ecclesiastical<br/>
independence was necessarily included; and the different religious<br/>
denominations of Christians in these States were left at full and equal<br/>
liberty to model and organize their respective Churches, and forms of<br/>
worship, and discipline, in such manner as they might judge most<br/>
convenient for their future prosperity; consistently with the constitution<br/>
and laws of their country.</p>

<p class="small">The attention of this Church was in the first place drawn to those<br/>
alterations in the Liturgy which became necessary in the prayers for our<br/>
Civil Rulers, in consequence of the Revolution. And the principal care<br/>
herein was to make them conformable to what ought to be the proper<br/>
end of all such prayers, namely, that &quot;Rulers may have grace, wisdom,</p>

<br/>
<br/>
<p class="leftfoot"><em>10</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Preface</em></p>
<hr/>
<br/>
<br/>

<p class="small">and understanding to execute justice, and to maintain truth;&quot; and that the<br/>
people &quot;may lead quiet and peaceable lives, in all godliness and honesty.&quot;</p>

<p class="small">But while these alterations were in review before the Convention, they<br/>
could not but, with gratitude to God, embrace the happy occasion which<br/>
was offered to them (uninfluenced and unrestrained by any worldly<br/>
authority whatsoever) to take a further review of the Public Service, and<br/>
to establish such other alterations and amendments therein as might be<br/>
deemed expedient.</p>

<p class="small">It seems unnecessary to enumerate all the different alterations and<br/>
amendments. They will appear, and it is to be hoped, the reasons of them<br/>
also, upon a comparison of this with the Book of Common Prayer of the<br/>
Church of England. In which it will also appear that this Church is far<br/>
from intending to depart from the Church of England in any essential<br/>
point of doctrine, discipline, or worship; or further than local <br/>
circumstances require.</p>

<p class="small">And now, this important work being brought to a conclusion, it is hoped<br/>
the whole will be received and examined by every true member of our<br/>
Church, and every sincere Christian, with a meek, candid, and charitable<br/>
frame of mind; without prejudice or prepossessions; seriously considering<br/>
what Christianity is, and what the truths of the Gospel are; and earnestly<br/>
beseeching Almighty God to accompany with his blessing every endeavour<br/>
for promulgating them to mankind in the clearest, plainest, most affecting<br/>
and majestic manner, for the sake of Jesus Christ, our blessed<br/>
Lord and Saviour.</p>
