<p class="small">I certify that this edition of The Book of Common Prayer<br/>
has been compared with a certified copy of the Standard Book,<br/>
as the Canon directs, and that it conforms thereto, noting that<br/>
it has been amended by action of the 2006 General Convention<br/>
to include the Revised Common Lectionary.<br/>
