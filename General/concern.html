<h1>Concerning the Service<br/>
of the Church</strong></h1>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<p class="small">The Holy Eucharist, the principal act of Christian worship on the Lord's<br/>
Day and other major Feasts, and Daily Morning and Evening Prayer, as<br/>
set forth in this Book, are the regular services appointed for public<br/>
worship in the Church.</p>

<p class="small">In addition to these services and the other rites contained in this Book,<br/>
other forms set forth by authority within this Church may be used. Also,<br/>
subject to the direction of the bishop, special devotions taken from this<br/>
Book, or from Holy Scripture, may be used when the needs of the<br/>
congregation so require.</p>

<p class="small">For special days of fasting or thanksgiving, appointed by civil or Church<br/>
authority, and for other special occasions for which no service or prayer<br/>
has been provided in this Book, the bishop may set forth such forms as<br/>
are fitting to the occasion.</p>

<p class="small">In all services, the entire Christian assembly participates in such a way<br/>
that the members of each order within the Church, lay persons, bishops,<br/>
priests, and deacons, fulfill the functions proper to their respective<br/>
orders, as set forth in the rubrical directions for each service.</p>

<p class="small">The leader of worship in a Christian assembly is normally a bishop or<br/>
priest. Deacons by virtue of their order do not exercise a presiding<br/>
function; but, like lay persons, may officiate in the Liturgy of the Word,<br/>
whether in the form provided in the Daily Office, or (when a bishop or<br/>
priest is not present) in the form appointed at the Eucharist.  Under<br/>
exceptional circumstances, when the services of a priest cannotbe<br/>
obtained, the bishop may, at discretion, authorize a deacon to preside</p>

<br/>

<p class="small">at other rites also, subject to the limitations described in the directions<br/>
for each service.</p>

<p class="small">In any of the Proper Liturgies for Special Days, and in other services<br/>
contained within this Book celebrated in the context of a Rite One service,<br/>
the contemporary idiom may be conformed to traditional language.</p>

<p class="small">Hymns referred to in the rubrics of this Book are to be understood as<br/>
those authorized by this Church. The words of anthems are to be from<br/>
Holy Scripture, or from this Book, or from texts congruent with them.</p>

<p class="small">On occasion, and as appropriate, instrumental music may be substituted<br/>
for a hymn or anthem.</p>

<p class="small">Where rubrics indicate that a part of a service is to be &quot;said,&quot; it must be<br/>
understood to include &quot;or sung,&quot; and <em>vice versa</em>.</p>

<p class="small">When it is desired to use music composed for them, previously authorized<br/>
liturgical texts may be used in place of the corresponding texts in this<br/>
Book.</p>

<p class="small">Scriptural citations in this Book, except for the Psalms, follow the<br/>
numeration of the Revised Standard Version of the Bible.</p>
