<p><strong>The Song of Mary</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Magnificat</em><br/>
<em class="small">&nbsp;Luke 1:46-55</em><br/>
</p>

<p>
My soul doth magnify the Lord, *<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Savior.<br/>
For he hath regarded *<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the lowliness of his handmaiden.<br/>
For behold from henceforth *<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all generations shall call me blessed.<br/>
For he that is mighty hath magnified me, *<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and holy is his Name.<br/>
And his mercy is on them that fear him *<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;throughout all generations.<br/>
He hath showed strength with his arm; *<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he hath scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts.<br/>
He hath put down the mighty from their seat, *<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and hath exalted the humble and meek.<br/>
He hath filled the hungry with good things, *<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the rich he hath sent empty away.<br/>
He remembering his mercy hath holpen his servant Israel, *<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as he promised to our forefathers,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abraham and his seed for ever.<br/>
</p>

<p>
Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever. Amen.<br/>
