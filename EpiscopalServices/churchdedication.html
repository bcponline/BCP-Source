<h1>The Dedication and<br/>
Consecration of a Church</h1>


<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<p class="rubric">On the day appointed, the clergy and people gather with the bishop in a <br/>
place apart from the church or chapel.<br/>
<br/>
When all are ready, the Bishop says the following or similar words</p>

<p>Through the ages, Almighty God has moved his people to <br/>
build houses of prayer and praise, and to set apart places for <br/>
the ministry of his holy Word and Sacraments. With gratitude <br/>
for the building (rebuilding, <em>or</em> adornment) of (<em>name of <br/>
church</em>), we are now gathered to dedicate and consecrate <br/>
it in God's Name.<br/>
<br/>

Let us pray.<br/>

<br/>
Almighty God, we thank you for making us in your image, to <br/>
share in the ordering of your world. Receive the work of our <br/>
hands in this place, now to be set apart for your worship, the <br/>
building up of the living, and the remembrance of the dead, <br/>
to the praise and glory of your Name; through Jesus Christ <br/>
our Lord. <em>Amen.</em></p>

<p class="rubric">Necessary announcements may now be made.<br/>
<br/>
As the procession approaches the door of the church, singing and <br/>
instrumental music are appropriate.</p>

<p class="rubric">Standing at the door of the church, the Bishop says</p>

<p>Let the door(s) be opened.</p>

<p class="rubric">The door is opened. With the pastoral staff the Bishop marks the <br/>
threshold with the sign of the cross saying</p>

<p>Peace be to this house, and to all who enter here: â€  In the <br/>
Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. <br/>
Amen.</p>

<p class="rubric">As the procession moves into the church, Psalm 122 or some other <br/>
appropriate psalm is sung. Hymns and anthems may also be sung.<br/>
<br/>
The congregation standing, the Bishop begins the Prayer for the <br/>
Consecration of the Church</p>

<p>Everliving Father, watchful and caring, our source and our <br/>
end: All that we are and all that we have is yours. Accept us <br/>
now, as we dedicate this place to which we come to praise <br/>
your Name, to ask your forgiveness, to know your healing <br/>
power, to hear your Word, and to be nourished by the Body <br/>
and Blood of your Son. Be present always to guide and to <br/>
judge, to illuminate and to bless your people.</p>

<p>Lord Jesus Christ, make this a temple of your presence and a <br/>
house of prayer. Be always near us when we seek you in this <br/>
place. Draw us to you, when we come alone and when we <br/>
come with others, to find comfort and wisdom, to be supported <br/>
and strengthened, to rejoice and give thanks. May it be here, <br/>
Lord Christ, that we are made one with you and with one </p>

<p class="rubric">The Rector or Minister in charge continues</p>

<p>Holy Spirit, open our eyes, our ears, and our hearts, that we <br/>
may grow closer to you through joy and through suffering. <br/>
Be with us in the fullness of your power as new members are <br/>
added to your household, as we grow in grace through the <br/>
years, when we are joined in marriage, when we turn to you <br/>
in sickness or special need, and, at the last, when we are <br/>
committed into the Father's hands.</p>

<p>Father, we thank you that through the waters of Baptism we <br/>
die to sin and are made new in Christ. Grant through your <br/>

<p class="rubric">Facing the Font, the Bishop says</p>

<p>We thank you, Almighty God, for the gift of water. Over it <br/>
the Holy Spirit moved in the beginning of creation. Through <br/>
it you led the children of Israel out of their bondage in Egypt <br/>
into the land of promise. In it your Son Jesus received the <br/>
baptism of John and was anointed by the Holy Spirit as the <br/>
Messiah, the Christ, to lead us, through his death and <br/>
resurrection, from the bondage of sin into everlasting life.<br/>
<br/>
We thank you, Father, for the water of Baptism. In it we are <br/>
buried with Christ in his death. By it we share in his resurrection. <br/>
Through it we are reborn by the Holy Spirit. Therefore in <br/>
joyful obedience to your Son, we bring into his fellowship <br/>
those who come to him in faith, baptizing them in the Name <br/>
of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.<br/>
<br/>
Grant, by the power of your Holy Spirit, that those who here <br/>
are cleansed from sin and born again may continue for ever <br/>
in the risen life of Jesus Christ our Savior.<br/>
<br/>
To him, to you, and to the Holy Spirit, be all honor and <br/>
glory, now and for ever. <em>Amen.</em></p>

<p class="rubric">The Bishop proceeds to the Lectern, lays a hand upon it, and says</p>

<p>Father, your eternal Word speaks to us through the words of <br/>

purposes in history, and about those whom you chose as the </p>

we seek your present purposes. Give us ears to hear and <br/>
hearts to obey.<br/>

<br/>
We dedicate the Lectern in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and <br/>
of the Holy Spirit. <em>Amen.</em></p>

<p class="rubric">The Bishop goes to the pulpit, lays a hand upon it, and says</p>

<p>Father, in every age you have spoken through the voices of <br/>
prophets, pastors, and teachers. Purify the lives and the lips <br/>
of those who speak here, that your word only may be <br/>
proclaimed, and your word only may be heard.<br/>
<br/>
V.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your word is a lantern to our feet,<br/>
R.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And a light upon our path.<br/>

We dedicate this Pulpit in the Name of the Father, and of the <br/>
Son, and of the Holy Spirit. <em>Amen.</em></p>

<h2>At the Liturgy of the Word</h2>

<p class="rubric">Three Lessons are read. Lay persons read the Old Testament Lesson and <br/>
the Epistle. The Deacon (or a Priest) reads the Gospel. Selections are <br/>
ordinarily made from the following list; but on a Major Feast, Sunday,
or <br/>
Patronal Feast, selections may be made from the Proper of the Day.<br/>

<p class="rubric">When an instrument of music is to be dedicated, after the Epistle the <br/>
Bishop proceeds to an appropriate place, and says</p>

<p>Father, your people worship you with many voices and <br/>
sounds, in times of joy and sorrow. Move us to express the <br/>
wonder, the power, and the glory of your creation in the <br/>
music we make and in the songs we sing.<br/>
<br/>
V.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Praise him with the sound of the trumpet;<br/>
R.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Praise him with strings and pipe.<br/>
<br/>
We dedicate this (<em>name of instrument</em>) in the Name of the <br/>
Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. <em>Amen.</em></p>

<p class="rubric">Instrumental music is now played, or a hymn or anthem sung.<br/>
<br/>
All then stand for the Gospel, which may be the following<br/>
<br/>
Matthew 7:13-14,24-25,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or Matthew 21:10-14</p>

<p><em>Sermon or Address</em></p>

<p class="rubric">Other Pastoral Offices may follow.<br/>
<br/>
If the Apostles' Creed has not already been said, the Nicene Creed is<br/>
now <br/>
said or sung.<br/>
<br/>
The Deacon or a member of the congregation leads the Prayers of the <br/>
People.<br/>
<br/>
After a period of silence, the Bishop concludes with the following prayers</p>

<p>Almighty God, all times are your seasons, and all occasions <br/>
invite your tender mercies: Accept our prayers and <br/>
intercessions offered in this place today and in the days to <br/>
come; through Jesus Christ, our Mediator and Advocate. <br/>
<em>Amen.</em></p>

<br/>
<br/>

<p>We give you thanks, O God, for the gifts of your people, and <br/>
for the work of many hands, which have beautified this place <br/>
and furnished it for the celebration of your holy mysteries. <br/>
Accept and bless all we have done, and grant that in these <br/>
earthly things we may behold the order and beauty of things <br/>
heavenly; through Jesus Christ our Lord. <em>Amen.</em></p>

<p class="rubric">The Bishop then says</p>

<br/>

<p>Let us now pray for the setting apart of the Altar.</p>

<p class="rubric">The Bishop goes to the Table and, with arms extended, says</p>

<p>We praise you, Almighty and eternal God, that for us and for <br/>
our salvation, you sent your Son Jesus Christ to be born <br/>
among us, that through him we might become your sons and <br/>
daughters.<br/>
<em>Blessed be your Name, Lord God.</em><br/>
<br/>
We praise you for his life on earth, and for his death upon the <br/>
cross, through which he offered himself as a perfect sacrifice.<br/>
<em>Blessed be your Name, Lord God.</em><br/>
<br/>
We praise you for raising him from the dead, and for exalting <br/>
him to be our great High Priest.<br/>
<em>Blessed be your Name, Lord God.</em><br/>
<br/>
We praise you for sending your Holy Spirit to make us holy, <br/>
and to unite us in your holy Church.<br/>
<em>Blessed be your Name, Lord God.</em></p>

<p class="rubric">The Bishop lays a hand upon the Table, and continues</p>

<br/>
<br/>
<p class="rightfoot"><em>Consecration of a Church</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;573</p>
<hr>
<br/>
<br/>

<p>Lord God, hear us. Sanctify this Table dedicated to you. Let <br/>
it be to us a sign of the heavenly Altar where your saints and <br/>
angels praise you for ever. Accept here the continual recalling <br/>
of the sacrifice of your Son. Grant that all who eat and drink <br/>
at this holy Table may be fed and refreshed by his flesh and <br/>
blood, be forgiven for their sins, united with one another, and <br/>
strengthened for your service.<br/>
<em>Blessed be your Name, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit; now <br/>
and for endless ages. Amen.</em></p>

<p class="rubric">Bells may now be rung and music played. Members of the congregation <br/>
vest the Altar, place the vessels on it, and light the candles.</p>


<h2>The Peace</h2>

<p class="rubric">The Bishop says to the people</p>
