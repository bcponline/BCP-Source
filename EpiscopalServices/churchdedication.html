<p><font face="Goudy Old Style"><i><font size="2">On the day appointed, the clergy and people gather with the bishop in a <br>
place apart from the church or chapel.<br>
<br>
When all are ready, the Bishop says the following or similar words<br>
<br>
</font></i>Through the ages, Almighty God has moved his people to <br>
build houses of prayer and praise, and to set apart places for <br>
the ministry of his holy Word and Sacraments. With gratitude <br>
for the building (rebuilding, or adornment) of (<i>name of <br>
church</i>), we are now gathered to dedicate and consecrate <br>
it in God's Name.<br>
<br>
Let us pray.<br>
<font size="2">
<br>
</font>Almighty God, we thank you for making us in your image, to <br>
share in the ordering of your world. Receive the work of our <br>
hands in this place, now to be set apart for your worship, the <br>
building up of the living, and the remembrance of the dead, <br>
to the praise and glory of your Name; through Jesus Christ <br>
our Lord. <i>Amen.</i><br>
<i><font size="2">
<br>
Necessary announcements may now be made.<br>
<br>
As the procession approaches the door of the church, singing and <br>
instrumental music are appropriate.</font></i></font></p>

As the procession moves into the church, Psalm 122 or some other <br>
appropriate psalm is sung. Hymns and anthems may also be sung.<br>

the Holy Spirit moved in the beginning of creation. Through <br>
it you led the children of Israel out of their bondage in Egypt <br>
