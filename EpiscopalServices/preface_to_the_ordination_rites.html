<h2>Preface to the Ordination Rites</h2>

<br/>
<p class="smaller">The Holy Scriptures and ancient Christian writers make it clear that from <br/>
the apostles' time, there have been different ministries within the Church. <br/>
In particular, since the time of the New Testament, three distinct orders <br/>
of ordained ministers have been characteristic of Christ's holy Catholic <br/>
Church. First, there is the order of bishops who carry on the apostolic <br/>
work of leading, supervising, and uniting the Church.&nbsp; Secondly, <br/>
associated with them are the presbyters, or ordained elders, in subsequent <br/>
times generally known as priests. Together with the bishops, they take <br/>
part in the governance of the Church, in the carrying out of its missionary <br/>
and pastoral work, and in the preaching of the Word of God and <br/>
administering his holy Sacraments. Thirdly, there are deacons who assist <br/>
bishops and priests in all of this work. It is also a special responsibility of<br/>
deacons to minister in Christ's name to the poor, the sick, the suffering, <br/>
and the helpless.<br/>
<br/>
The persons who are chosen and recognized by the Church as being <br/>
called by God to the ordained ministry are admitted to these sacred <br/>
orders by solemn prayer and the laying on of episcopal hands. It has <br/>
been, and is, the intention and purpose of this Church to maintain and <br/>
continue these three orders; and for this purpose these services of <br/>
ordination and consecration are appointed. No persons are allowed to <br/>
exercise the offices of bishop, priest, or deacon in this Church unless they <br/>
are so ordained, or have already received such ordination with the laying <br/>
on of hands by bishops who are themselves duly qualified to confer Holy <br/>
Orders.<br/>
<br/>
It is also recognized and affirmed that the threefold ministry is not the <br/>
exclusive property of this portion of Christ's catholic Church, but is a gift
<br/>
from God for the nurture of his people and the proclamation of his <br/>
Gospel everywhere. Accordingly, the manner of ordaining in this Church <br/>
is to be such as has been, and is, most generally recognized by Christian <br/>
people as suitable for the conferring of the sacred orders of bishop, priest,<br/>
and deacon.</p>
