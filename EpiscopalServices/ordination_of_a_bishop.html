<br>
</font></i>My <i>brother</i>, the people have chosen you and have affirmed <br>
their trust in you by acclaiming your election. A bishop in <br>
God's holy Church is called to be one with the apostles in <br>
proclaiming Christ's resurrection and interpreting the Gospel, <br>
and to testify to Christ's sovereignty as Lord of lords and <br>
King of kings.<br>
<br>
You are called to guard the faith, unity, and discipline of the <br>
Church; to celebrate and to provide for the administration of <br>
the sacraments of the New Covenant; to ordain priests and <br>
deacons and to join in ordaining bishops; and to be in all <br>
things a faithful pastor and wholesome example for the <br>
entire flock of Christ.<br>
<br>
With your fellow bishops you will share in the leadership of <br>
the Church throughout the world. Your heritage is the faith <br>
of patriarchs, prophets, apostles, and martyrs, and those of <br>
every generation who have looked to God in hope. Your joy <br>
will be to follow him who came, not to be served, but to <br>
serve, and to give his life a ransom for many.<br>
<br>
Are you persuaded that God has called you to the office of <br>
bishop?</font></p>

We give you thanks that from the beginning you have <br>
gathered and prepared a people to be heirs of the covenant of <br>
Abraham, and have raised up prophets, kings, and priests, <br>
never leaving your temple untended. We praise you also that <br>
from the creation you have graciously accepted the ministry <br>
of those whom you have chosen.</font></p>

out upon <i>him</i> the power of your princely Spirit, whom you <br>
bestowed upon your beloved Son Jesus Christ, with whom he <br>
endowed the apostles, and by whom your Church is built up in <br>

</font></i>To you, O Father, all hearts are open; fill, we pray, the heart <br>
of this your servant whom you have chosen to be a bishop in <br>
your Church, with such love of you and of all the people, that <br>
<i>he</i> may feed and tend the flock of Christ, and exercise <br>
without reproach the high priesthood to which you have <br>
called <i>him</i>, serving before you day and night in the ministry <br>
of reconciliation, declaring pardon in your Name, offering the <br>
holy gifts, and wisely overseeing the life and work of the <br>
Church. In
all things may <i>he</i> present before you the acceptable <br>
offering of a
pure, and gentle, and holy life; through Jesus <br>
Christ your Son, to whom,
with you and the Holy Spirit, be <br>
honor and power and glory in the
