<h2>The Presentation</h2>

<p class="rubric">The bishops and people sit. Representatives of the diocese, both Priests <br/>
and Lay Persons, standing before the Presiding Bishop, present the <br/>
bishop-elect, saying</p>

<p><em>N.</em>, Bishop in the Church of God, the clergy and people of <br/>
the Diocese of <em>N.</em>, trusting in the guidance of the Holy Spirit, <br/>
have chosen <em>N.N.</em> to be a bishop and chief pastor. We therefore <br/>
ask you to lay your hands upon <em>him</em> and in the power of the <br/>
Holy Spirit to consecrate <em>him</em> a bishop in the one, holy, <br/>
catholic, and apostolic Church.</p>

<p class="rubric">The Presiding Bishop then directs that the testimonials of the election be <br/>
read.<br/>
<br/>
When the reading of the testimonials is ended, the Presiding Bishop <br/>
requires the following promise from the Bishop-elect</p>

<p>In the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy <br/>
Spirit, I, <em>N.N.</em>, chosen Bishop of the Church in <em>N.</em>, solemnly <br/>
declare that I do believe the Holy Scriptures of the Old and <br/>
New Testaments to be the Word of God, and to contain all<br/>
things necessary to salvation; and I do solemnly engage to <br/>
conform to the doctrine, discipline, and worship of the <br/>
Episcopal Church.</p>

<p class="rubric">The Bishop-elect then signs the above Declaration in the sight of all <br/>
present. The witnesses add their signatures.<br/>
<br/>
All stand.<br/>
<br/>
The Presiding Bishop then says the following, or similar words, and
asks <br/>
the response of the people</p>

<br/>
<br/>
<p class="rightfoot"><em>Ordination: Bishop</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;513</p>
<hr>
<br/>
<br/>

<p>Brothers and sisters in Christ Jesus, you have heard testimony <br/>
given that <em>N.N.</em> has been duly and lawfully elected to be a <br/>
bishop of the Church of God to serve in the Diocese of <em>N.</em> <br/>
You have been assured of <em>his</em> suitability and that the Church <br/>
has approved <em>him</em> for this sacred responsibility. Nevertheless, <br/>
if any of you know any reason why we should not proceed, <br/>
let it now be made known.</p>

<p class="rubric">If no objection is made, the Presiding Bishop continues</p>

<p>Is it your will that we ordain <em>N.</em> a bishop?</p>

<p class="rubric">The People respond in these or other words</p>

<p>That is our will.</p>

<p class="rubric">Presiding Bishop</p>

<p>Will you uphold <em>N.</em> as bishop?</p>

<p class="rubric">The People respond in these or other words</p>

<p>We will.</p>

<p class="rubric">The Presiding Bishop then says</p>

<p>The Scriptures tell us that our Savior Christ spent the whole <br/>
night in prayer before he chose and sent forth his twelve <br/>
apostles. Likewise, the apostles prayed before they appointed <br/>
Matthias to be one of their number. Let us, therefore, follow <br/>
their examples, and offer our prayers to Almighty God before <br/>
we ordain <em>N.</em> for the work to which we trust the Holy Spirit <br/>
has called <em>him</em>.</p>

<p class="rubric">All kneel, and the Person appointed leads the Litany for Ordinations, or <br/>

<p>Let us pray.<br/>
<br/>
O God of unchangeable power and eternal light: Look <br/>
favorably on your whole Church, that wonderful and sacred <br/>
mystery; by the effectual working of your providence, carry <br/>
out in tranquillity the plan of salvation; let the whole world <br/>
see and know that things which were cast down are being <br/>
raised up, and things which had grown old are being made <br/>
new, and that all things are being brought to their perfection <br/>
by him through whom all things were made, your Son Jesus <br/>
Christ our Lord; who lives and reigns with you, in the unity <br/>
of the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever. <em>Amen.</em></p>

<h2>The Examination</h2>

<p class="rubric">All now sit, except the bishop-elect, who stands facing the bishops.  The <br/>
Presiding Bishop addresses the bishop-elect</p>

<p>My <em>brother</em>, the people have chosen you and have affirmed <br/>
their trust in you by acclaiming your election. A bishop in <br/>
God's holy Church is called to be one with the apostles in <br/>
proclaiming Christ's resurrection and interpreting the Gospel, <br/>
and to testify to Christ's sovereignty as Lord of lords and <br/>
King of kings.<br/>
<br/>
You are called to guard the faith, unity, and discipline of the <br/>
Church; to celebrate and to provide for the administration of <br/>
the sacraments of the New Covenant; to ordain priests and <br/>
deacons and to join in ordaining bishops; and to be in all <br/>
things a faithful pastor and wholesome example for the <br/>
entire flock of Christ.<br/>
<br/>
With your fellow bishops you will share in the leadership of <br/>
the Church throughout the world. Your heritage is the faith <br/>
of patriarchs, prophets, apostles, and martyrs, and those of <br/>
every generation who have looked to God in hope. Your joy <br/>
will be to follow him who came, not to be served, but to <br/>
serve, and to give his life a ransom for many.<br/>
<br/>
Are you persuaded that God has called you to the office of <br/>
bishop?</p>
