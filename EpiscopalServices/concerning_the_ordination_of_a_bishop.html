<h2 class="concern">Concerning the <br/>
Ordination of a Bishop</h2>

<br/>
<p class="small">In accordance with ancient custom, it is desirable, if possible, that <br/>
bishops be ordained on Sundays and other feasts of our Lord or on the <br/>
feasts of apostles or evangelists.</p>

<p class="small">When a bishop is to be ordained, the Presiding Bishop of this Church, or a <br/>
bishop appointed by the Presiding Bishop, presides and serves as chief <br/>
consecrator. At least two other bishops are co-consecrators. <br/>
Representatives of the presbyterate, diaconate, and laity of the diocese <br/>
for which the new bishop is to be consecrated, are assigned appropriate <br/>
duties in the service.</p>

<p class="small">From the beginning of the service until the Offertory, the chief <br/>
consecrator presides from a chair placed close to the people, so that all <br/>
may see and hear what is done. The other bishops, or a convenient <br/>
number of them, sit to the right and left of the chief consecrator.</p>

<p class="small">The bishop-elect is vested in a rochet or alb, without stole, tippet, or <br/>
other vesture distinctive of ecclesiastical or academic rank or order.</p>

<p class="small">When the bishop-elect is presented, <em>his</em> full name (designated by the <br/>
symbol <em>N.N.</em>) is used. Thereafter, it is appropriate to refer to <em>him</em> only by <br/>
the Christian name by which <em>he</em> wishes to be known.</p>

<p class="small">At the Offertory, it is appropriate that the bread and wine be brought to <br/>
the Altar by the family or friends of the newly ordained.</p>

<p class="small">The family of the newly ordained may receive Communion before other <br/>
members of the congregation. Opportunity is always given to the people <br/>
to communicate.</p>
