<h2 class="direct">Additional Directions</h2>

<br/>
<p><em>At all Ordinations</em></p>

<p class="small">The celebration of the Holy Eucharist may be according to Rite One or <br/>
Rite Two. In either case, the rubrics of the service of ordination are <br/>
followed. The Summary of the Law, the Gloria in excelsis, the Prayers of <br/>
the People after the Creed, the General Confession, and the usual <br/>
postcommunion prayer are not used.</p>

<p class="small">At the Presentation of the Ordinand, the Declaration &quot;I do believe the <br/>
Holy Scriptures . . .&quot; is to be provided as a separate document to be <br/>
signed, as directed by Article VIII of the Constitution of this Church and <br/>
by the rubrics in each of the ordination rites. (Where there are more <br/>
ordinands than one, each is to be presented with a separate copy for <br/>
signature.)</p>

<p class="small">The hymn to the Holy Spirit before the Prayer of Consecration may be <br/>
sung responsively between a bishop and the congregation, or in some <br/>
other convenient manner.</p>

<p class="small">If vestments or other symbols of office are to be dedicated, such blessing <br/>
is to take place at some convenient time prior to the service. The <br/>
following form may be used.</p>

<p>Let us pray.<br/>
<br/>
Everliving God, whose power is limitless, we place before <br/>
you, with our praise and thanks, <em>these tokens</em> of your <br/>
servant's ministry and dignity. Grant that <em>N.</em>, who has been <br/>
called to leadership in your Church, and bears <em>these signs</em>, <br/>
may faithfully serve you and share in the fullness of your <br/>
life-giving Spirit; through the high priest and good shepherd <br/>
of us all, Jesus Christ our Lord. <em>Amen.</em></p>

<hr>
<br/>
<br/>

<p><em>At the Ordination of a Bishop</em></p>

<p class="small">Following the Consecration Prayer, and while the new bishop is being <br/>
clothed with the vesture of the episcopate, instrumental music may be <br/>
played.</p>

<p class="small">Following the presentation of the Bible, and the formula &quot;Receive the <br/>
Holy Scriptures . . .&quot; a ring, staff, and mitre, or other suitable <br/>
insignia of office may be presented.</p>

<p class="small">During the Eucharistic Prayer, it is appropriate that some of the <br/>
consecrating bishops, and representative presbyters of the diocese, stand <br/>
with the new bishop at the Altar as fellow ministers of the Sacrament.</p>

<p class="small">The newly ordained bishop, assisted by other ministers, distributes Holy <br/>
Communion to the people. When necessary, the administration may take <br/>
place at several conveniently separated places in the church.</p>

<p class="small">After the pontifical blessing and the dismissal, a hymn of praise may be <br/>
sung.</p>

<p class="small">The bishops who are present are not to depart without signing the Letters <br/>
of Consecration.</p>

<p><em>At the Ordination of a Priest</em></p>

<p class="small">Reasonable opportunity is to be given for the priests present to join in the <br/>
laying on of hands.</p>

<p class="small">The stole worn about the neck, or other insignia of the office of priest, is <br/>
placed upon the new priest after the entire Prayer of Consecration is <br/>
completed, and immediately before the Bible is presented. Afterwards, <br/>
other instruments or symbols of office may be given.</p>

<p class="small">If two or more are ordained together, each is to have <em>his</em> own presenters.<br/>
The ordinands may be presented together, or in succession, as the bishop <br/>
may direct. Thereafter, references to the ordinand in the singular are <br/>
changed to the plural where necessary. The ordinands are examined <br/>
together.</p>

<p class="small">During the Prayer of Consecration, the bishop and priests lay their hands <br/>
upon the head of each ordinand. During the laying on of hands, the <br/>
bishop alone says over each ordinand &quot;Father, through Jesus Christ your </p>

<p class="small">Son, give your Holy Spirit to <em>N.</em>; fill <em>him</em> with grace and power, and make <br/>
<em>him</em> a priest in your Church.&quot; When they have laid their hands upon all<br/>
the ordinands, the bishop continues &quot;May the exalt you, O Lord, in the <br/>
midst . . .&quot;</p>

<p class="small">A Bible is to be given to each new priest, and the words &quot;Receive this <br/>
Bible . . .&quot; are to be said to each one.</p>

<p class="small">All the newly ordained take part in the exchange of the Peace, and join <br/>
the bishop and other priests at the Altar for the Great Thanksgiving. <br/>
Similarly, all the new priests break the consecrated Bread and receive <br/>
Holy Communion.</p>

<p><em>At the Ordination of a Deacon</em></p>

<p class="small">The stole worn over the left shoulder, or other insignia of the office of <br/>
deacon, is placed upon the deacon after the entire Prayer of <br/>
Consecration is completed, and immediately before the Bible is given.</p>

<p class="small">If two or more are ordained together, each is to have <em>his</em> own presenters.<br/>
The ordinands may be presented together, or in succession, as the bishop <br/>
may direct. Thereafter, references to the ordinand in the singular are <br/>
changed to the plural where necessary.&nbsp; The ordinands are examined 
together.</p>

<p class="small">During the Prayer of Consecration the bishop is to lay hands upon the <br/>
head of each ordinand, and say over each one &quot;Father, through Jesus <br/>
Christ your Son, give your Holy Spirit to <em>N.</em>; fill <em>him</em> with grace and <br/>
power, and make <em>him</em> a deacon in your Church.&quot; After laying hands <br/>
upon all the ordinands, the bishop continues &quot;Make them, O Lord, <br/>
modest and humble . . .&quot;</p>

<p class="small">A Bible is to be given to each new deacon, and the words &quot;Receive this <br/>
Bible . . .&quot; are also to be said to each one.</p>

<p class="small">After participating in the Peace, the deacons go to the Altar for the <br/>
Offertory. If there are many deacons, some assist in the Offertory and <br/>
others administer Holy Communion. One, appointed by the bishop, is <br/>
to say the dismissal.</p>

<br/>
<br/>

<p class="small">When desired, deacons may be appointed to carry the Sacrament and <br/>
minister Holy Communion to those communicants who, because of <br/>
sickness or other grave cause, could not be present at the ordination.</p>

<p class="small">If the remaining Elements are not required for the Communion of the <br/>
absent, it is appropriate for the deacons to remove the vessels from the <br/>
Altar, consume the remaining Elements, and cleanse the vessels in some <br/>
convenient place.</p>
