church, and may say</p>

<p>O Lord my God, I am not worthy to have you come under <br/>
my roof; yet you have called your servant to stand in your <br/>
house, and to serve at your altar. To you and to your service <br/>
I devote myself, body, soul, and spirit. Fill my memory with <br/>
the record of your mighty works; enlighten my understanding <br/>
with the light of your Holy Spirit; and may all the desires of <br/>
my heart and will center in what you would have me do. Make </p>

<p>me an instrument of your salvation for the people entrusted <br/>
to my care, and grant that I may faithfully administer your <br/>
holy Sacraments, and by my life and teaching set forth your <br/>
true and living Word. Be always with me in carrying out the <br/>
duties of my ministry. In prayer, quicken my devotion; in <br/>
praises, heighten my love and gratitude; in preaching, give me <br/>
readiness of thought and expression; and grant that, by the <br/>
clearness and brightness of your holy Word, all the world may <br/>
be drawn into your blessed kingdom. All this I ask for the <br/>
sake of your Son our Savior Jesus Christ. <em>Amen.</em></p>

<h3>At the Eucharist</h3>

<p class="rubric">The service continues with the Offertory.<br/>
<br/>
The Bishop, or in the Bishop's absence a Priest beginning a new <br/>
ministry, standing at the Lord's Table as chief celebrant, and joined <br/>
by the other clergy, proceeds with the Great Thanksgiving of the <br/>
Eucharist.</p>

<br/>
<br/>

<p class="rubric">Except on Major Feasts, the Preface may be that for Apostles and <br/>
Ordinations.</p>

<br/>

<h3>After Communion</h3>

<p class="rubric">At the Induction of a priest or deacon, in place of the usual post-<br/>
communion prayer, the Bishop leads the people in the following prayer; <br/>
but if the new minister is a lay person, the usual postcommunion prayer <br/>
is used.</p>

<p>Almighty Father, we thank you for feeding us with the holy <br/>
food of the Body and Blood of your Son, and for uniting us <br/>
through him in the fellowship of your Holy Spirit. We thank <br/>
you for raising up among us faithful servants for the ministry <br/>
of your Word and Sacraments. We pray that <em>N.</em> may be to us <br/>
an effective example in word and action, in love and patience, <br/>
and in holiness of life. Grant that we, with <em>him</em>, may serve <br/>
you now, and always rejoice in your glory; through Jesus <br/>
Christ your Son our Lord, who lives and reigns with you and <br/>
the Holy Spirit, one God, now and for ever. Amen.</p>

<p class="rubric">A newly inducted Priest may, at the bishop's request, pronounce <br/>
a blessing.<br/>
<br/>
A Deacon, or a Priest if no deacon is present, dismisses the assembly.</p>

<br/>
<p class="adddirect"><a name="Additional Directions">Additional Directions</a></p>

<p class="rubric">The Institution, the Ministry of the Word, and the Induction should <br/>
occur at the entrance of the chancel, or in some other place where the <br/>
bishop and other ministers may be clearly seen and heard by the people.<br/>
<br/>
The Letter of Institution is appropriate for the induction of a rector of a <br/>
parish, the dean of a cathedral, and others having similar tenure of office.</p>

<br/>
<br/>
<p class="leftfoot">564&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>New Ministry</em></p>
<hr>
<br/>
<br/>

<p class="rubric">Its wording may be altered by the bishop when circumstances require. In <br/>
other cases, the bishop may state briefly the nature of the person's office <br/>
and the authority being conferred.<br/>
<br/>
The new minister is normally presented to the bishop by the wardens of <br/>
the parish, but additional, or other, persons may do this when desired.<br/>
<br/>
The Litany may be sung or said standing or kneeling, but the bishop <br/>
always stands for the salutation and Collect at the end of it. The Collect <br/>
of the Day, or a Collect of the season, or another prayer suitable to the <br/>
occasion, may be used instead.<br/>
<br/>
<a name="Readings"></a>Before the Gospel, there may be one or two Readings from Scripture. Any <br/>
of the Readings, including the Gospel, may be selected from the Proper <br/>
of the Day, or from the passages cited in the service. Other passages suitable <br/>
to the circumstances may be substituted. Appropriate selections may be <br/>
found in the service for the Ordination of a Deacon or in the Lectionary <br/>
for Various Occasions.<br/>
<br/>
The sermon may be preached by the bishop, the new minister, or some <br/>
other person; or an address about the work of the congregation and of the <br/>
new minister may be made. Representatives of the congregation or of the <br/>
community, the bishop, or other persons present, may speak in response <br/>
to the address or sermon.<br/>
<br/>
The symbols presented should be large enough to be visible to all and <br/>
should remain in the sight of the congregation during the Induction. The <br/>
vestments and bread and wine may be used in the Eucharist which follows.<br/>
<br/>
The priest's prayer on page 562 is appropriate only for rectors of parishes, <br/>
vicars of missions, hospital chaplains, and other priests having similar <br/>
canonical charge.<br/>
<br/>
For the Great Thanksgiving, any of the authorized eucharistic prayers <br/>
may be used.</p>
