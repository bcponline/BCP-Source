food of the Body and Blood of your Son, and for uniting us <br>
through him in the fellowship of your Holy Spirit. We thank <br>
you for raising up among us faithful servants for the ministry <br>
of your Word and Sacraments. We pray that <i>N.</i> may be to us <br>
an effective example in word and action, in love and patience, <br>
and in holiness of life. Grant that we, with <i>him</i>, may serve <br>
you now, and always rejoice in your glory; through Jesus <br>
Christ your Son our Lord, who lives and reigns with you and <br>
the Holy Spirit, one God, now and for ever. Amen.<br>

occur at the entrance of the chancel, or in some other place where the <br>

<font size="2">Its wording may be altered by the bishop when circumstances require. In <br>
other cases, the bishop may state briefly the nature of the person's
office <br>
and the authority being conferred.<br>
<br>
The new minister is normally presented to the bishop by the wardens of <br>
the parish, but additional, or other, persons may do this when desired.<br>
<br>
The Litany may be sung or said standing or kneeling, but the bishop <br>
always stands for the salutation and Collect at the end of it. The
Collect <br>
of the Day, or a Collect of the season, or another prayer
suitable to the <br>
occasion, may be used instead.<br>
<br>
<a name="Readings"></a>Before the Gospel, there may be one or two Readings from Scripture. Any <br>
of the Readings, including the Gospel, may be selected from the Proper <br>
of the Day, or from the passages cited in the service. Other passages
suitable <br>
to the circumstances may be substituted. Appropriate selections
may be <br>
found in the service for the Ordination of a Deacon or in the
Lectionary <br>
for Various Occasions.<br>
<br>
The sermon may be preached by the bishop, the new minister, or some <br>
other person; or an address about the work of the congregation and of
the <br>
new minister may be made. Representatives of the congregation or of
the <br>
community, the bishop, or other persons present, may speak in
response <br>
to the address or sermon.<br>
<br>
The symbols presented should be large enough to be visible to all and <br>
should remain in the sight of the congregation during the Induction. The <br>
vestments and bread and wine may be used in the Eucharist which
follows.<br>
<br>
The priest's prayer on page 562 is appropriate only for rectors of
parishes, <br>
vicars of missions, hospital chaplains, and other priests
having similar <br>
canonical charge.<br>
<br>
For the Great Thanksgiving, any of the authorize eucharistic prayers <br>
may be used.</font></font></p>
