<h2 class="concern">Concerning the Service</h2>
<br/>
<font size="2">When a bishop is to confer Holy Orders, at least two presbyters must be <br/>
present.</p>

<p class="small">From the beginning of the service until the Offertory, the bishop presides <br/>
from a chair placed close to the people, and facing them, so that all may <br/>
see and hear what is done.</p>

<p class="small">The ordinand is to be vested in surplice or alb, without stole, tippet, or <br/>
other vesture distinctive of ecclesiastical or academic or order.</p>

<p class="small">When the ordinand is presented, <i>his</i> full name (designated by the symbol<br/>
<i>N.N.</i>) is used. Thereafter, it is appropriate to refer to <i>him</i> only by the <br/>
Christian name by which <i>he</i> wishes to be known.</p>

<p class="small">At the Offertory, it is appropriate that the bread and wine be brought to <br/>
the Altar by the family and friends of the newly ordained.</p>

<p class="small">At the Great Thanksgiving, the new priest and other priests stand at the <br/>
Altar with the bishop, as associates and fellow ministers of the<br/>
Sacrament, and communicate with the bishop.</p>

<p class="small">The family of the newly ordained may receive Communion before other <br/>
members of the congregation. Opportunity is always given to the people <br/>
to communicate.</p>

<p class="small">Additional Directions are on page <a href="additional_directions_ordinations.html">552</a>.</p>
