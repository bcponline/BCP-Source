<title>Additional Directions - Consecration of a Church</title>
</head>

<body>

<h2 class="direct">Additional Directions</h2>

<br/>
<p class="small">The complete form of the service for the Dedication and Consecration of <br/>
a Church is to be used at the opening of a church or chapel. This service <br/>
does not require that the premises be debt-free or owned.</p>

<p class="small">When the clergy and people assemble before the service, they may gather <br/>
out of doors, in the parish house, in a former or neighboring place of <br/>
worship, or in some other building. When convenient, the procession <br/>
may go around the building(s) to be dedicated and then go to the <br/>
principal door. Hymns or psalms may be used in procession. The use of <br/>
portable musical instruments is suitable. If there is an organ, it is <br/>
appropriate that it remain silent until dedicated. When the weather is <br/>
inclement, or other circumstances make it necessary, the congregation <br/>
may assemble inside the church; but the bishop, other clergy, and <br/>
attendants will enter in procession through the principal door.</p>

<p class="small">When a new church is being consecrated, it is desirable that sacred <br/>
vessels, ornaments, and decorations be carried into the building in the <br/>
procession. Such things as the deed for the property and the blueprint of <br/>
the building(s), the keys, and the tools used in its construction may also be<br/>
carried by appropriate persons.</p>

<p class="small">The cross signed on the threshold by the bishop may be marked in lasting <br/>
from (incised, painted, inlaid). In place of a pastoral staff, the foot of <br/>
a processional cross may be used for the signing.</p>

<p class="small">At the dedication of the font, children or other lay persons are to be <br/>
assigned the task of pouring the water. If Holy Baptism is not to be <br/>
administered, in addition to saying the prayer over the font as given, the <br/>
bishop may consecrate oil of Chrism, as in the service of Holy Baptism, <br/>
for subsequent use in this church.</p>

<p class="small">If Baptism is to be administered, the following order is used: The Gospel <br/>
from &quot;At Baptism,&quot; page 928; then the service of Holy Baptism, beginning <br/>
with the Presentation of the Candidates, and concluding with the <br/>
reception of the newly baptized.</p>

<br/>
<br/>

<p class="small">As the furnishings in the church are dedicated, they may be decorated by <br/>
members of the congregation with flowers, candles, hangings, or other <br/>
ornaments.</p>

<p class="small">Selected verses of psalms and hymns, or instrumental music may be used <br/>
as the ministers move from one part of the church to another.</p>

<p class="small">If one reading stand is to serve as both lectern and pulpit, only one of the <br/>
prayers, and one of the versicles and responses, are used, followed by the <br/>
words of dedication.</p>

<p class="small">At the dedication of the lectern, the Bible is brought forward and put into <br/>
place by a donor, or a lay reader, or another suitable person.</p>

<p class="small">If there is an address instead of a sermon, it is suitable that a warden or <br/>
other lay person outline the plans of the congregation for witness to the <br/>
Gospel. The bishop may respond, indicating the place of this congregation <br/>
within the life of the Diocese.</p>

<p class="small">The sermon or address may be followed by an appropriate Pastoral <br/>
Office, such as Thanksgiving for the Birth or Adoption of a Child, <br/>
Commitment to Christian Service, or Blessing of Oil for the Sick.</p>

<p class="small">Any of the usual forms of the Prayers of the People may be used; or some <br/>
other form may be composed for the occasion, having due regard for the <br/>
distinctive nature of the community, and with commemoration of <br/>
benefactors, donors, artists, artisans, and others.</p>

<p class="small">For the covering and decoration of the Altar, it is suitable that the donors <br/>
of these furnishings, or other lay persons, bring them forward and put <br/>
them in place. If incense is to be used, it is appropriate at this time.</p>

<p class="small">Instead of the Proper Preface suggested, that of the season may be used, <br/>
or one appropriate to the name of the church.</p>

<br/>
<p id="Special Circumstances"><em>For the Dedication of Churches <br/>
and Chapels in Special Cases</em></p>

<p class="small">If the place of public worship is also to serve as a school or parish hall, or<br/>
for some other suitable purpose, the service may be adapted to the <br/>
circumstances.</p>

<br/>
<br/>
<p class="leftfoot">576&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Consecration of a Church</em></p>
<hr>
<br/>
<br/>

<p class="small">If the church is also to be used for regular worship by other Christian <br/>
bodies, it is appropriate that their representatives take part in the service,<br/>
and that the service be adapted.</p>

<p class="small">Suitable portions of this service may be used by the bishop, or by a priest <br/>
with the bishop's permission, for dedicating a private chapel or oratory.</p>

<br/>
<p id="furnishings"><em>For the Dedication of Furnishings, <br/>
or Parts of a Church or Chapel</em></p>

<p class="small">Relevant portions of the service for the Dedication and Consecration of a <br/>
Church may be used by the bishop or a priest for blessing alterations, <br/>
additions, or new furnishings in a church or chapel. In each such case, the <br/>
appropriate prayer may be said, or adapted to the circumstances; and <br/>
prayers and Bible readings related to the particular occasion may be <br/>
selected. When possible, the areas or furnishings should be put into use at <br/>
this time.</p>

<p class="small">The blessing of a new font or baptistry should always be done by a<br/>
bishop, and should be followed, if possible, by the administration of <br/>
Holy Baptism.</p>

<p class="small">The blessing of an Altar is also reserved for a bishop, and is always to be <br/>
followed by the celebration of the Holy Eucharist.</p>

<br/>
<p id="Chapel Long in Use"><em>For a Church or Chapel Long in Use</em></p>

<p class="small">When buildings have been used for public worship for an extended <br/>
period of time without having been consecrated, the following order may <br/>
provide an opportunity for the congregation to reaffirm its commitment <br/>
to its mission and ministry, and it will be particularly appropriate when a <br/>
congregation attains recognition as a parish.</p>

<p class="small">1. Proession<br/>
2. Signing of threshold<br/>
