<h2 class="concern">Concerning the Service</h2>

<p class="small">This order is for use when a priest is being instituted and inducted as the <br/>
rector of a parish. It may also be used for the installation of deans and <br/>
canons of cathedrals, or the inauguration of other ministries, diocesan <br/>
or parochial, including vicars of missions and assistant ministers. <br/>
Alterations in the service are then made according to circumstances.</p>

<p class="small">The chief minister is normally the bishop; but, if necessary, a deputy <br/>
may be appointed. The bishop, when present, is the chief celebrant of <br/>
the Eucharist. In the bishop's absence, a priest being inducted is the <br/>
chief celebrant.</p>

<p class="small">Other priests, if any, who serve in the same congregation also stand with <br/>
the chief celebrant at the Altar, and deacons assist according to their <br/>
order.</p>

<p class="small">Lay persons from the congregation read the Old Testament Lesson and <br/>
the Epistle, and perform other actions as indicated in the rubrics. A <br/>
deacon or priest reads the Gospel. Other clergy of the diocese participate <br/>
in this celebration as an expression of the collegiality of the ministry in <br/>
which they share.</p>

<p class="small">Ministers of other Churches may appropriately be invited to participate.</p>

<p class="small">The new minister, if a deacon, should read the Gospel, prepare the <br/>
elements at the Offertory, assist the celebration at the Altar, and <br/>
dismiss the congregation.</p>

<p class="small">A lay person being instituted should read one of the Lessons and <br/>
assist where appropriate.</p>
