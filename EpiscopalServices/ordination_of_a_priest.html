<h2>The Presentation</h2>

<p class="rubric">The bishop and people sit. A Priest and a Lay Person, and additional <br/>
presenters if desired, standing before the bishop, present the ordinand, <br/>
saying</p>

<p>N.</em>, Bishop in the Church of God, on behalf of the clergy and <br/>
people of the Diocese of <em>N.</em>, we present to you <em>N.N.</em> to be <br/>
ordained a priest in Christ's holy catholic Church.</p>

<p class="rubric">Bishop</p>

<p>Has <em>he</em> been selected in accordance with the canons of this <br/>
Church? And do you believe <em>his</em> manner of life to be suitable <br/>
to the exercise of this ministry?</p>

<p class="rubric">Presenters</p>

<p>We certify to you that <em>he</em> has satisfied the requirements of the <br/>
canons, and we believe <em>him</em> to be qualified for this order.</p>

<p class="rubric">The Bishop says to the ordinand</p>

<p>Will you be loyal to the doctrine, discipline, and worship of <br/>
Christ as this Church has received them? And will you, in <br/>
accordance with the canons of this Church, obey your bishop <br/>
and other ministers who may have authority over you and <br/>
your work?</p>

<p class="rubric">Answer</p>

<p>I am willing and ready to do so; and I solemnly declare that I <br/>
do believe the Holy Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments <br/>
to be the Word of God, and to contain all things necessary to <br/>
salvation; and I do solemnly engage to conform to the doctrine, <br/>
discipline, and worship of The Episcopal Church.</p>

<p class="rubric">The Ordinand then signs the above Declaration in the sight of all present. </p>

<p class="rubric">All stand. The Bishop says to the people</p>

<p>Dear friends in Christ, you know the importance of this <br/>
ministry, and the weight of your responsibility in presenting <br/>
<em>N.N.</em> for ordination to the sacred priesthood. Therefore if <br/>
any of you know any impediment or crime because of which <br/>
we should not proceed, come forward now, and make it <br/>
known.</p>

<p class="rubric">If no objection is made, the Bishop continues</p>

<p>Is it your will that <em>N.</em> be ordained a priest?</p>

<p class="rubric">The People respond in these or other words</p>

<p>It is.</p>

<p class="rubric">Bishop</p>
<p>Will you uphold <em>him</em> in this ministry?</b>

<p class="rubric">The People respond in these or other words</p>

<p>We will.</p>

<p class="rubric">The Bishop then calls the people to prayer with these or similar words</p>

<p>In peace let us pray to the Lord.</p>

<p class="rubric">All kneel, and the Person appointed leads the Litany for Ordinations, or <br/>
some other approved litany. At the end of the litany, after the Kyries, the <br/>
Bishop stands and reads the Collect for the Day, or the following Collect, <br/>
or both, first saying</p>

<p>Let us pray.<br/>
<br/>
O God of unchangeable power and eternal light: Look <br/>
favorably on your whole Church, that wonderful and sacred <br/>
mystery; by the effectual working of your providence, carry <br/>
out in tranquillity the plan of salvation; let the whole world <br/>
see and know that things which were being cast down are being <br/>
raised up, and things which had grown old are being made <br/>
new, and that all things are being brought to their perfection <br/>
by him through whom all things were made, your Son Jesus <br/>
Christ our Lord; who lives and reigns with you, in the unity <br/>
of the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever. <em>Amen.</em></p>

<h2>The Ministry of the Word</h2>

<p class="rubric">Three Lessons are read. Lay persons read the Old Testament Lesson and <br/>
the Epistle.</p>

<h3>The Sermon</h3>

<p class="rubric">The Congregation then says or sings the Nicene Creed</p>

<p>We believe in one God,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Father, the Almighty,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;maker of heaven and earth,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of all that is, seen and unseen.</p>

<br/>
<br/>
<p>We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ, <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the only Son of God,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;eternally begotten of the Father, <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God from God, Light from Light,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;true God from true God,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;begotten, not made,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of one Being with the Father. <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through him all things were made. <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For us and for our salvation<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he came down from heaven:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by the power of the Holy Spirit<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and was made man.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he suffered death and was buried.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the third day he rose again<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in accordance with the Scriptures;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he ascended into heaven<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and his kingdom will have no end.<br/>
<br/>
We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life, <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who proceeds from the Father and the Son.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the Father and the Son he is worshipped and glorified.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has spoken through the Prophets.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We look for the resurrection of the dead,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the life of the world to come. Amen.</p>

<h2>The Examination</h2>

<p class="rubric">All are seated except the ordinand, who stands before the Bishop. <br/>
The Bishop addresses the ordinand as follows</p>

<p>My <em>brother</em>, the Church is the family of God, the body of <br/>
Christ, and the temple of the Holy Spirit. All baptized people <br/>
are called to make Christ known as Savior and Lord, and to <br/>
share in the renewing of his world. Now you are called to <br/>
work as pastor, priest, and teacher, together with your <br/>
bishop and fellow presbyters, and to take your share in the <br/>
councils of the Church.<br/>
<br/>
As a priest, it will be your task to proclaim by word and deed <br/>
the Gospel of Jesus Christ, and to fashion your life in <br/>
accordance with its precepts. You are to love and serve the <br/>
people among whom you work, caring alike for young and <br/>
old, strong and weak, rich and poor. You are to preach, to <br/>
declare God's forgiveness to penitent sinners, to pronounce <br/>
God's blessing, to share in the administration of Holy <br/>
Baptism and in the celebration of the mysteries of Christ's <br/>
Body and Blood, and to perform the other ministrations <br/>
entrusted to you.<br/>
<br/>
In all that you do, you are to nourish Christ's people from the <br/>
riches of his grace, and strengthen them to glorify God in this <br/>
life and in the life to come.<br/>
<br/>
My <em>brother</em>, do you believe that you are truly called by God <br/>
and his Church to this priesthood?</p>

<h2>The Consecration of the Priest</h2>

<p class="rubric">All now stand except the ordinand, who kneels facing the Bishop.<br/>
<br/>
The hymn, Veni Creator Spiritus, or the hymn, Veni Sancte Spiritus, is <br/>
sung.<br/>
<br/>
A period of silent prayer follows, the people still standing.<br/>
<br/>
The Bishop then says this Prayer of Consecration</p>

<p>God and Father of all, we praise you for your infinite love in <br/>
calling us to be a holy people in the kingdom of your Son <br/>
Jesus our Lord, who is the image of your eternal and invisible <br/>
glory, the firstborn among many brethren, and the head of <br/>
the Church. We thank you that by his death he has overcome <br/>
death, and, having ascended into heaven, has poured his gifts <br/>
abundantly upon your people, making some apostles, some <br/>
prophets, some evangelists, some pastors and teachers, to <br/>
equip the saints for the work of ministry and the building up <br/>
of his body.</p>

<p class="rubric">Here the Bishop lays hands upon the head of the ordinand, the <br/>
Priests who are present also laying on their hands. At the same time <br/>
the Bishop prays</p>

<p>Therefore, Father, through Jesus Christ your Son, give <br/>
your Holy Spirit to <em>N.</em>; fill <em>him</em> with grace and power, and <br/>
make <em>him</em> a priest in your Church.</p>

<p class="rubric">The Bishop then continues</p>

<p>May <em>he</em> exalt you, O Lord, in the midst of your people; offer <br/>
spiritual sacrifices acceptable to you; boldly proclaim the <br/>
gospel of salvation; and rightly administer the sacraments of <br/>
the New Covenant. Make <em>him</em> a faithful pastor, a patient <br/>
teacher, and a wise councilor. Grant that in all things <em>he</em> may <br/>
serve without reproach, so that your people may be <br/>
strengthened and your Name glorified in all the world. All <br/>
this we ask through Jesus Christ our Lord, who with you and <br/>
the Holy Spirit lives and reigns, one God, for ever and ever.</p>

<p class="rubric">The new priest is now vested according to the order of priests.<br/>
<br/>
The Bishop then gives a Bible to the newly ordained, saying</p>

<p>Receive this Bible as a sign of the authority given you to <br/>
preach the Word of God and to administer his holy <br/>
Sacraments. Do not forget the trust committed to you as a <br/>
priest of the Church of God.</p>

<h3>After Communion</h3>

<p class="rubric">In place of the usual postcommunion prayer, the following is said</p>

<p>Almighty Father, we thank you for feeding us with the holy <br/>
food of the Body and Blood of your Son, and for uniting us <br/>
through him in the fellowship of your Holy Spirit. We thank <br/>
you for raising up among us faithful servants for the ministry <br/>
of your Word and Sacraments. We pray that <em>N.</em> may be to us <br/>
an effective example in word and action, in love and patience, <br/>
and in holiness of life. Grant that we, with <em>him</em>, may serve <br/>
you now, and always rejoice in your glory; through Jesus <br/>
Christ your Son our Lord, who lives and reigns with you and <br/>
the Holy Spirit, one God, now and for ever. <em>Amen.</em></p>
