<h2>The Presentation</h2>

<p class="rubric">The bishop and people sit. A Priest and a Lay Person, and additional <br/>
presenters if desired, standing before the bishop, present the ordinand, <br/>
saying</p>

people of the Diocese of <em>N.</em>, we present to you <em>N.N.</em> to be <br/>
ordained a deacon in Christ's holy catholic Church.</p>

<p class="rubric">Bishop</p>

<p>Has <em>he</em> been selected in accordance with the canons of this <br/>
Church? And do you believe <em>his</em> manner of life to be suitable <br/>
to the exercise of this ministry?</p>

<p class="rubric">Presenters</p>

<p>We certify to you that <em>he</em> has satisfied the requirements of the <br/>
canons, and we believe <em>him</em> to be qualified for this order.</p>

<p class="rubric">The Bishop says to the ordinand</p>

<p>Will you be loyal to the doctrine, discipline, and worship of <br/>
Christ as this Church has received them? And will you, in <br/>
accordance with the canons of this Church, obey your bishop <br/>
and other ministers who may have authority over you and <br/>
your work?</p>

<p class="rubric">Answer</p>

<p>I am willing and ready to do so; and I solemnly declare that I <br/>
do believe the Holy Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments <br/>
to be the Word of God, and to contain all things necessary to <br/>
salvation; and I do solemnly engage to conform to the doctrine, <br/>
discipline, and worship of The Episcopal Church.</p>

<p>Dear friends in Christ, you know the importance of this <br/>

<em>N.N.</em> for ordination to the sacred order of deacons. Therefore if <br/>
any of you know any impediment or crime because of which <br/>
we should not proceed, come forward now, and make it <br/>
known.</p>

<h3>The Sermon</h3>

<br/>

<p class="rubric">The Congregation then says or sings the Nicene Creed</p>

<p>We believe in one God,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Father, the Almighty,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;maker of heaven and earth,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of all that is, seen and unseen.</p>

<p>We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ, <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the only Son of God,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;eternally begotten of the Father, <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God from God, Light from Light,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;true God from true God,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;begotten, not made,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of one Being with the Father. <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through him all things were made. <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For us and for our salvation<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he came down from heaven:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by the power of the Holy Spirit<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and was made man.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he suffered death and was buried.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the third day he rose again<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in accordance with the Scriptures;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he ascended into heaven<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and his kingdom will have no end.<br/>
<br/>
We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life, <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who proceeds from the Father and the Son.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the Father and the Son he is worshipped and glorified.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has spoken through the Prophets.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We look for the resurrection of the dead,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the life of the world to come. Amen.</p>

<h2>The Examination</h2>

<p class="rubric">All are seated except the ordinand, who stands before the Bishop. <br/>
The Bishop addresses the ordinand as follows</p>

<p>My <em>brother</em>, every Christian is called to follow Jesus Christ, <br/>
serving God the Father, through the power of the Holy Spirit. <br/>
God now calls you to a special ministry of servanthood <br/>
directly under your bishop. In the name of Jesus Christ, you <br/>
are to serve all people, particularly the poor, the weak, the <br/>
sick, and the lonely.<br/>
<br/>
As a deacon in the Church, you are to study the Holy <br/>
Scriptures, to seek nourishment from them, and to model <br/>
your life upon them. You are to make Christ and his <br/>
redemptive love known, by your word and example, to those <br/>
among whom you live, and work, and worship. You are to <br/>
interpret to the Church the needs, concerns, and hopes of the <br/>
world. You are to assist the bishop and priests in public <br/>
worship and in the ministration of God's Word and <br/>
Sacraments, and you are to carry out other duties assigned to <br/>
you from time to time. At all times, your life and teaching are <br/>
to show Christ's people that in serving the helpless they are <br/>
serving Christ himself. <br/>
<br/>
My <em>brother</em>, do you believe that you are truly called by God <br/>
and his Church to the life and work of a deacon?</p>

<p>O God, most merciful Father, we praise you for sending your <br/>
Son Jesus Christ, who took on himself the form of a servant, <br/>
and humbled himself, becoming obedient even to death on <br/>
the cross. We praise you that you have highly exalted him, <br/>
and made him Lord of all; and that, through him, we know <br/>
that whoever would be great must be servant of all. We praise <br/>
you for the many ministries in your Church, and for calling <br/>
this your servant to the order of deacons.</p>

<p class="rubric">Here the Bishop lays hands upon the head of the ordinand, and prays</p>

<p>Therefore, Father, through Jesus Christ your Son, give your <br/>
Holy Spirit to <em>N.</em>; fill <em>him</em> with grace and power, and make <br/>
<em>him</em> a deacon in your Church.</p>

<p class="rubric">The Bishop continues</p>

<p>Make <em>him</em>, O Lord, modest and humble, strong and constant, <br/>
to observe the discipline of Christ. Let <em>his</em> life and teaching so <br/>
reflect your commandments, that through <em>him</em> many may <br/>
come to know you and love you. As your Son came not to be <br/>
served but to serve, may this deacon share in Christ's service, <br/>
and come to the unending glory of him who, with you and <br/>
the Holy Spirit, lives and reigns, one God, for ever and ever. </p>
