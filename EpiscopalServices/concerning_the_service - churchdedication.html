<h2 class="concern">Concerning the Service</h2>

<p class="small">This service provides for the dedication and consecration of a church and <br/>
its furnishings. Portions of the service may be used, or adapted when <br/>
necessary, for dedicating parts of a building, or furnishings, that have been<br/>
added, altered, or renovated. Likewise, suitable parts of this rite may be <br/>
used for dedicating a chapel or an oratory within another building. <br/>
Provisions for adapting the rite to special circumstances are given on <br/>
page <a href="additional_directions_churchdedication.html#Special Circumstances">
576</a>.</p>

<p class="small">This service may be used to dedicate and consecrate a church at any time <br/>
after the building is ready for use as a place of worship.</p>

<p class="small">The service does not preclude the use of the building for educational or <br/>
social purposes, or for other suitable activities.</p>

<p class="small">The bishop presides. The rector or minister in charge takes part as <br/>
indicated. Neighboring ministers should be invited to participate, and <br/>
may be assigned appropriate parts in the service.</p>

<p class="small">It is desirable that all members of the congregation, young and old, <br/>
have some individual or collective part in the celebration, as well as the <br/>
architect, builders, musicians, artists, benefactors, and friends.</p>

<p class="small">For a church or chapel long in use, a special order is provided on page
