<p>Blessed Lord, who hast caused all holy Scriptures to be <br/>
written for our learning: Grant that we may in such wise<br/>
hear them, read, mark, learn, and inwardly digest them; that,<br/>
by patience and comfort of thy holy Word, we may embrace <br/>
and ever hold fast the blessed hope of everlasting life, which <br/>
thou hast given us in our Savior Jesus Christ; who liveth and <br/>
reigneth with thee and the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and <br/>
ever. <em>Amen.</em> </p>

<p>Almighty and everlasting God, whose will it is to restore all <br/>
things in thy well-beloved Son, the King of kings and Lord of <br/>
lords: Mercifully grant that the peoples of the earth, divided <br/>
and enslaved by sin, may be freed and brought together<br/>
under his most gracious rule; who liveth and reigneth with <br/>
thee and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and for ever. <em>Amen.</em> </p>
