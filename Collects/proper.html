<title>Concerning the Proper of the Church Year</title>
</head>

<body>

<h2><em>Concerning the Proper<br/>
of the Church Year</em><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</h2>

<p class="small">The Proper of the Church Year includes the appointed Collects; the<br/>
Proper Prefaces, directions for which are to be found in the pages<br/>
following; and the appointed Psalms and Lessons, which appear in tables<br/>
beginning on page 889.</p>

<p class="small">The Proper appointed for the Sunday is also used at celebrations of the <br/>
Eucharist on the weekdays following, unless otherwise ordered for Holy<br/>
Days and Various Occasions.</p>

<p class="small">The Proper to be used on each of the Sundays after Pentecost (except for<br/>
Trinity Sunday) is determined by the calendar date of that Sunday.&nbsp; Thus,<br/>
in any year, the Proper for the Sunday after Trinity Sunday (the Second<br/>
Sunday after Pentecost) is the numbered Proper (number 3 through<br/>
number 8), the calendar date of which falls on that Sunday, or is closest<br/>
to it, whether before or after.&nbsp; Thereafter, the Propers are used<br/>
consecutively.&nbsp; For example, if the Sunday after Trinity Sunday is May 26,<br/>
the sequence begins with Proper 3 (Propers 1 and 2 being used on the<br/>
weekdays of Pentecost and Trinity weeks).&nbsp; If the Sunday after Trinity<br/>
Sunday is June 13, the sequence begins with Proper 6 (Propers 1 through<br/>
3 being omitted that year, and Propers 4 and 5 being used in Pentecost<br/>
and Trinity weeks).&nbsp; See also the Table on pages <a href="../Misc/tables.html#hdtable">884-885</a>.</p>

<p class="small">The Collect appointed for any Sunday or other Feast may be used at the<br/>
evening service of the day before.</p>

<p class="small">Directions concerning the Common of Saints and services for Various<br/>
Occasions are on pages <a href="commont.html">195</a>, <a href="varioust.html">199</a>, <a href="commonc.html">246</a> and <a href="variousc.html">251</a>.</p>
