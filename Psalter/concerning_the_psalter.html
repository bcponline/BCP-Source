<h2 class="concern">Concerning the Psalter</h2>

<br/>
<p class="small">The Psalter is a body of liturgical poetry. It is designed for vocal, <br/>
congregational use, whether by singing or reading. There are several <br/>
traditional methods of psalmody. The exclusive use of a single method <br/>
makes the recitation of the Psalter needlessly monotonous. The <br/>
traditional methods, each of which can be elaborate or simple, are the <br/>
following:</p>

<p class="small"><strong>Direct recitation</strong> denotes the reading or chanting of a whole psalm, or <br/>
portion of a psalm, in unison. It is particularly appropriate for the psalm <br/>
verses suggested in the lectionary for use between the Lessons at the <br/>
Eucharist, when the verses are recited rather than sung, and may often be <br/>
found a satisfactory method of chanting them.</p>

<p class="small"><strong>Antiphonal recitation</strong> is the verse-by-verse alternation between groups of <br/>
singers or readers; <em>e.g.</em>, between choir and congregation, or between one<br/>
side of the congregation and the other. The alternate recitation concludes <br/>
either with the Gloria Patri, or with a refrain (called the antiphon) recited
<br/>in unison. This is probably the most satisfying method for reciting the <br/>
psalms in the Daily Office.</p>

<p class="small"><strong>Responsorial recitation</strong> is the name given to a method of psalmody in <br/>
which the verses of a psalm are sung by a solo voice, with the choir and <br/>
congregation singing a refrain after each verse or group of verses. This <br/>
was the traditional method of singing the Venite, and the restoration of <br/>
Invitatory Antiphons for the Venite makes possible a recovery of this <br/>
form of sacred song in the Daily Office. It was also a traditional manner <br/>
of chanting the psalms between the Lessons at the Eucharist, and it is <br/>
increasingly favored by modern composers.</p>

<p class="small"><strong>Responsive recitation</strong> is the method which has been most frequently used <br/>
in Episcopal churches, the minister alternating with the congregation, <br/>
verse by verse.</p>

<p class="small">The version of the Psalms which follows is set out in lines of poetry. The <br/>
lines correspond to Hebrew versification, which is not based on meter or <br/>
rhyme, but on parallelism of clauses, a symmetry of form and sense. The <br/>
parallelism can take the form of similarity (The waters have lifted up, O <br/>
Lord I the waters have lifted up their voice; / the waters have lifted up <br/>
their pounding waves. <em>Psalm 93:4</em>), or of contrast (The Lord knows the <br/>
ways of the righteous; / but the way of the wicked is doomed. <em>Psalm 1:6</em>),<br/>
or of logical expansion (Our eyes look to the Lord our God, / until he <br/>
show us his mercy. <em>Psalm 123:3</em>). </p>

<p class="small">The most common verse is a couplet, but triplets are very frequent, and <br/>
quatrains are not unknown; although quatrains are usually distributed <br/>
over two verses.</p>

<p class="small">An asterisk divides each verse into two parts for reading or chanting. In <br/>
reading, a distinct pause should be made at the asterisk. </p>

<p class="small">Three terms are used in the Psalms with reference to God: <em>Elohim</em> <br/>
(&quot;God&quot;), <em>Adonai</em> (&quot;Lord&quot;) and the personal name <em>YHWH</em>. The &quot;Four-<br/>
letter Name&quot; (Tetragrammaton) is probably to be vocalized Yahweh; but <br/>
this is by no means certain, because from very ancient times it has been <br/>
considered too sacred to be pronounced; and, whenever it occurred, <br/>
Adonai was substituted for it. In the oldest manuscripts, the Divine <br/>
Name was written in antique and obsolete letters; in more recent <br/>
manuscripts and in printed Bibles, after the invention of vowel points, the <br/>
Name was provided with the vowels of the word <em>Adonai</em>. This produced <br/>
a hybrid form which has been transliterated &quot;Jehovah.&quot; </p>

<p class="small">The Hebrew reverence and reticence with regard to the Name of God has <br/>
been carried over into the classical English versions, the Prayer Book <br/>
Psalter and the King James Old Testament, where it is regularly render <br/>
&quot;Lord&quot;. In order to distinguish it, however, from &quot;Lord&quot; as a translation <br/>
of <em>Adonai</em>, <em>YHWH</em> is represented in capital and small capital letters: <br/>
L<span style="font-size: x-small">ORD</span>.</p>

<p class="small">From time to time, the Hebrew text has <em>Adonai</em> and <em>YHWH</em> in <br/>
conjunction. Then, the Hebrew custom is to substitute <em>Elohim</em> for <em><br/>
YHWH</em>, and our English tradition follows suit, rendering the combine <br/>
title as &quot;Lord G<span style="font-size: x-small">OD</span>.&quot;

<br/>

<p class="small">In two passages (<em>Psalm 68:4</em> and<em>Psalm 83:18</em>), the context requires that <br/>
the Divine Name be spelled out, and it appears as <em>Y<span style="font-size: x-small">AHWEH</span></em>. A similar <br/>
construction occurs in the Canticle, &quot;The Song of Moses.&quot; </p>

<p class="small">The ancient praise-shout, &quot;Hallelujah,&quot; has been restored, in place of its <br/>
English equivalent, &quot;Praise the Lord.&quot; The Hebrew form has been used, <br/>
rather than the Latin form &quot;Alleluia,&quot; as being more appropriate to this <br/>
context; but also to regain for our liturgy a form of the word that is <br/>
familiar from its use in many well-known anthems. The word may, if <br/>
desired, be omitted during the season of Lent.</p>
