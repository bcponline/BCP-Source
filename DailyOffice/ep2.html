Rite Two</h1><br/>

sentences of Scripture, or of those on pages 75-78;<br/>
<br/>

appointed Psalmody;<br/>
<br/>
or with the versicle &quot;O God, make speed to save us&quot; on page 117</p>

Let my prayer be set forth in your sight as incense, the lifting<br/>
up of my hands as the evening sacrifice.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em class="small">Psalm 141:2</em><br/>
<br/>

Grace to you and peace from God our Father and from the<br/>
Lord Jesus Christ.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em class="small">Philippians 1:2</em><br/>
<br/>

Worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness; let the whole earth<br/>
tremble before him.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em class="small">Psalm 96:9</em><br/>
<br/>

Yours is the day, O God, yours also the night; you established<br/>
the moon and the sun. You fixed all the boundaries of the<br/>
earth; you made both summer and winter.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em class="small">Psalm 74:15,16</em><br/>
<br/>

I will bless the Lord who gives me counsel; my heart teaches<br/>
me, night after night. I have set the Lord always before me;<br/>
because he is at my right hand, I shall not fall.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em class="small">Psalm 16:7,8</em><br/>
<br/>

Seek him who made the Pleiades and Orion, and turns deep<br/>
darkness into the morning, and darkens the day into night;<br/>
who calls for the waters of the sea and pours them out upon<br/>
the surface of the earth: The Lord is his name.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em class="small">Amos 5:8</em></p>

<br/>
If I say, &quot;Surely the darkness will cover me, and the light<br/>
around me turn to night,&quot; darkness is not dark to you, O<br/>
Lord; the night is as bright as the day; darkness and light to<br/>
you are both alike.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em class="small">Psalm 139:10,11</em><br/>
<br/>

Jesus said, &quot;I am the light of the world; whoever follows me<br/>
will not walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.&quot;<br/>

infinite goodness and mercy.</p>

He has cast down the mighty from their thrones, *<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and has lifted up the lowly. <br/>
He has filled the hungry with good things, *<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the rich he has sent away empty. <br/>
He has come to the help of his servant Israel, *<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for he has remembered his promise of mercy, <br/>

<p class="rubric">Officiant and People together, all standing</p>

<p>I believe in God, the Father almighty, <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;creator of heaven and earth; <br/>
I believe in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord. <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was conceived by the power of the Holy Spirit <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and born of the Virgin Mary. <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suffered under Pontius Pilate, <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was crucified, died, and was buried. <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He descended to the dead. <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the third day he rose again. <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He ascended into heaven, <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and is seated at the right hand of the Father. <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He will come again to judge the living and the dead. <br/>
I believe in the Holy Spirit, <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the holy catholic Church, <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the communion of saints, <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the forgiveness of sins,<br/>
