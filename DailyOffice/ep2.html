<h2>Daily Evening Prayer:<br/>
Rite Two</h2><br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<p class="rubric" id="sentences">The Officiant begins the service with one or more of the following<br/>
sentences of Scripture, or of those on pages 75-78;</p>

<p class="rubric"><em>or with the Service of Light on pages 109-112, and continuing with the<br/>

Let my prayer be set forth in your sight as incense, the lifting<br/>
up of my hands as the evening sacrifice. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="2"><em>Psalm 141:2</em></font><br/>
<br/>

Grace to you and peace from God our Father and from the<br/>
Lord Jesus Christ. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="2"><em>Philippians 1:2</em></font><br/>
<br/>

Worship the Lord in the beauty of his holiness; let the whole earth<br/>
tremble before him. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="2"><em>Psalm 96:9</em></font><br/>
<br/>

Yours is the day, O God, yours also the night; you established<br/>
the moon and the sun. You fixed all the boundaries of the<br/>
earth; you made both summer and winter. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="2"><em>Psalm 74:15,16</em></font><br/>
<br/>

I will bless the Lord who gives me counsel; my heart teaches<br/>
me, night after night. I have set the Lord always before me;<br/>
because he is at my right hand, I shall not fall. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="2"><em>Psalm 16:7,8</em></font><br/>
<br/>

Seek him who made the Pleiades and Orion, and turns deep<br/>
darkness into the morning, and darkens the day into night;<br/>
who calls for the waters of the sea and pours them out upon<br/>
the surface of the earth: The Lord is his name. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="2"><em>Amos 5:8</em></font></p>

<br/>
If I say, &quot;Surely the darkness will cover me, and the light<br/>
around me turn to night,&quot; darkness is not dark to you, O<br/>
Lord; the night is as bright as the day; darkness and light to<br/>
you are both alike. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="2"><em>Psalm 139:10,11</em></font><br/>
<br/>

Jesus said, &quot;I am the light of the world; whoever follows me<br/>
will not walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.&quot;<br/>
<font size="2"><em>John 8:12</em></font><br/>
<br/>

<font size="2"><em>The Officiant says to the people</em></font><br/>

Dear friends in Christ, here in the presence of Almighty God,<br/>

confess our sins, that we may obtain forgiveness by his <br/>
infinite goodness and mercy.<br/>
<br/>

Most merciful God,<br/>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br/>
in thought, word, and deed,<br/>
by what we have done,<br/>
and by what we have left undone.<br/>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br/>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br/>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.</p>

He has cast down the mighty from their thrones, *<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and has lifted up the lowly. <br/>
He has filled the hungry with good things, *<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the rich he has sent away empty. <br/>

<p>I believe in God, the Father almighty,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;creator of heaven and earth. <br/>
I believe in Jesus Christ, his only son, our Lord.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was conceived by the power of the Holy Spirit<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and born of the Virgin Mary.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suffered under Pontius Pilate,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was crucified, died, and was buried.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He descended to the dead.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the third day he rose again.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He ascended into heaven,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and is seated at the right hand of the Father.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He will come again to judge the living and the dead. <br/>
I believe in the Holy Spirit,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the holy catholic Church,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the communion of saints,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the forgiveness of sins,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the resurrection of the body,<br/>
