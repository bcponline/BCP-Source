<h1>Daily Devotions for<br/>
Families and Individuals</h1><br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<p class="smaller">These devotions follow the basic structure of the Daily Office of the<br/>
Church.<br/>
<br/>
When more than one person is present, the Reading and the Collect<br/>
should be read by one person, and the other parts said in unison, or in<br/>
some other convenient manner. (For suggestions about reading the<br/>
Psalms, see <a href="../Psalter/concerning_the_psalter.html">page 582</a>.)<br/>
<br/>
For convenience, appropriate Psalms, Readings, and Collects are<br/>
provided in each service. When desired, however, the Collect of the<br/>
Day, or any of the Collects appointed in the Daily Offices, may be used<br/>
instead.<br/>
<br/>
The Psalms and Readings may be replaced by those appointed in<br/>
<br/>
a) the Lectionary for Sundays, Holy Days, the Common of Saints, and<br/>
Various Occasions, <a href="../RCL/concernlect.html">page 888</a><br/>
<br/>
b) the Daily Office Lectionary, <a href="../DOLectionary/concerndolect.html">page 934</a><br/>
<br/>
c) some other manual of devotion which provides daily selections for the<br/>
Church Year.</p>

<p>Open my lips, O Lord, *<br/>

Create in me a clean heart, O God, *<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and renew a right spirit within me.<br/>
Cast me not away from your presence *<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and take not your holy Spirit from me.<br/>
Give me the joy of your saving help again *<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and sustain me with your bountiful Spirit.<br/>
Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever. Amen. </p>

<p>O gracious light,<br/>
pure brightness of the everliving Father in heaven,<br/>
O Jesus Christ, holy and blessed!<br/>
<br/>
Now as we come to the setting of the sun,<br/>
and our eyes behold the vesper light,<br/>
we sing your praises, O God: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.<br/>
<br/>
You are worthy at all times to be praised by happy voices,<br/>
O Son of God, O Giver of Life,<br/>
and to be glorified through all the worlds.</p>

<p><em>A Reading</em></p>

<p>It is not ourselves that we proclaim; we proclaim Christ<br/>
Jesus as Lord, and ourselves as your servants, for Jesus' sake.<br/>
For the same God who said, &quot;Out of darkness let light<br/>
shine,&quot; has caused his light to shine within us, to give the<br/>
light of revelation--the revelation of the glory of God in the<br/>
face of Jesus Christ.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="2"><em>2 Corinthians 4:5-6</em></font></p>

<p>Lord Jesus, stay with us, for evening is at hand and the day is<br/>
past; be our companion in the way, kindle our hearts, and<br/>
awaken hope, that we may know you as you are revealed in<br/>
Scripture and the breaking of bread. Grant this for the sake<br/>
of your love. <em>Amen.</em> </p>

Christ our Lord. <em>Amen.</em> </p>
