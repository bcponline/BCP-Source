<h1>Daily Devotions for<br/>
Families and Individuals</h1><br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<p class="smaller">These devotions follow the basic structure of the Daily Office of the<br/>
Church.<br/>
<br/>
When more than one person is present, the Reading and the Collect<br/>
should be read by one person, and the other parts said in unison, or in<br/>
some other convenient manner. (For suggestions about reading the<br/>
Psalms, see <a href="../Psalter/concerning_the_psalter.html">page 582</a>.)<br/>
<br/>
For convenience, appropriate Psalms, Readings, and Collects are<br/>
provided in each service. When desired, however, the Collect of the<br/>
Day, or any of the Collects appointed in the Daily Offices, may be used<br/>
instead.<br/>
<br/>
The Psalms and Readings may be replaced by those appointed in<br/>
<br/>
a) the Lectionary for Sundays, Holy Days, the Common of Saints, and<br/>
Various Occasions, <a href="../RCL/concernlect.html">page 888</a><br/>
<br/>
b) the Daily Office Lectionary, <a href="../DOLectionary/concerndolect.html">page 934</a><br/>
<br/>
c) some other manual of devotion which provides daily selections for the<br/>
Church Year.</p>

<p><em>From Psalm 51</em></p>

<p>Open my lips, O Lord, *<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and my mouth shall proclaim your praise.<br/>
Create in me a clean heart, O God, *<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and renew a right spirit within me.<br/>
Cast me not away from your presence *<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and take not your holy Spirit from me.<br/>
Give me the joy of your saving help again *<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and sustain me with your bountiful Spirit.<br/>
Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever. Amen. </p>
