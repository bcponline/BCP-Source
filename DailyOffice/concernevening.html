<title>Concerning the Service: An Order of Worship for the Evening</title>
</head>

<body>

<p align="left"><em><strong>Concerning the Service </strong></em></p>

<p class="rubric">This Order provides a form of evening service or vespers for use on <br/>
suitable occasions in the late afternoon or evening. It may be used as a <br/>
complete rite in place of Evening Prayer, or as the introduction to <br/>
Evening Prayer or some other service, or as the prelude to an evening <br/>
meal or other activity. It is appropriate also for use in private houses.<br/>
<br/>
Any part or parts of this service may be lead by lay persons. A priest or <br/>
deacon, when presiding, should read the Prayer for Light, and the <br/>
Blessing or Dismissal at the end. The bishop, when present, should give <br/>
the Blessing.<br/>
<br/>
This order is not appropriate for use on Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday <br/>
in Holy Week, or on Good Friday. Easter Eve has its own form for the <br/>
Lighting of the Paschal Candle.<br/>
<br/>
For the Short Lesson at the beginning of the service, any one of the <br/>
following is also appropriate, especially for the seasons suggested: </p>
