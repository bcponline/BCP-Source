sentences of Scripture, or of those on pages <a href="mp1.html#sentences">37-40</a>;</p>

<p>Let my prayer be set forth in thy sight as the incense, and let<br/>
the lifting up of my hands be an evening sacrifice.<br/>
<em class="small">Psalm 141:2</em></p>

<p>Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and<br/>
from the Lord Jesus Christ. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em class="small">Philippians 1:2</em></p>

<p>O worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness; let the whole<br/>
earth stand in awe of him.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em class="small">Psalm 96:9</em></p>

<p>Thine is the day, O God, thine also the night; thou hast<br/>
established the moon and the sun. Thou hast fixed all the<br/>
boundaries of the earth; thou hast made summer and winter.<br/>
<em class="small">Psalm 74:15,16</em></p>

<p>I will bless the Lord, who giveth me counsel; my heart<br/>
teacheth me, night after night. I have set the Lord always<br/>
before me; because he is at my right hand, I shall not fall.<br/>

<p>Seek him that made the Pleiades and Orion, that turneth deep<br/>
darkness into the morning, and darkeneth the day into night;<br/>
that calleth for the waters of the sea, and poureth them out<br/>
upon the face of the earth: The Lord is his Name. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em class="small">Amos 5:8</em></p>

<p>If I say, &quot;Surely the darkness will cover me, and the light<br/>
around me turn to night,&quot; darkness is not dark to thee, O Lord;<br/>
the night is as bright as the day; darkness and light to thee<br/>
are both alike. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em class="small">Psalm 139:10,11</em></p>

<em>&nbsp;Luke 1:46-55</em><br/>
</p>

<p>My soul doth magnify the Lord, *<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Savior.<br/>
For he hath regarded *<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the lowliness of his handmaiden.<br/>
For behold from henceforth *<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all generations shall call me blessed.<br/>
For he that is mighty hath magnified me, *<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and holy is his Name.<br/>
And his mercy is on them that fear him *<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;throughout all generations.<br/>
He hath showed strength with his arm; *<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he hath scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts.<br/>
He hath put down the mighty from their seat, *<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and hath exalted the humble and meek.<br/>
He hath filled the hungry with good things, *<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the rich he hath sent empty away.<br/>
He remembering his mercy hath holpen his servant Israel, *<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as he promised to our forefathers,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abraham and his seed for ever. </p>

<p>I believe in God, the Father almighty,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;maker of heaven and earth;<br/>
And in Jesus Christ his only Son our Lord;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who was conceived by the Holy Ghost,<br/>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was crucified, dead, and buried.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He descended into hell.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third day he rose again from the dead.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He ascended into heaven,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and sitteth on the right hand of God the Father almighty.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From thence he shall come to judge the quick and the dead.<br/>
I believe in the Holy Ghost,<br/>
