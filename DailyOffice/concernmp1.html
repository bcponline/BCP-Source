<h2 class="concern">Concerning the Service</h2>

<br/>
<p class="small">In the Daily Office, the term &quot;Officiant&quot; is used to denote the person, <br/>
clerical or lay, who leads the Office.</p>

<p class="small">It is appropriate that other persons be assigned to read the Lessons, and <br/>
to lead other parts of the service not assigned to the officiant. The bishop, <br/>
when present, appropriately concludes the Office with a blessing.</p>

<p class="small">At celebrations of the Holy Eucharist, the Order for Morning or Evening <br/>
Prayer may be used in place of all that precedes the Offertory.</p>

<p class="small">Additional Directions are on <a href="direct.html">page 141</a>.<br/>
