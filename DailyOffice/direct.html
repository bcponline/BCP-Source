<p><em>Morning and Evening Prayer </em></p>

<p class="small">Any of the opening sentences of Scripture, including those listed for<br/>
specific seasons or days, may be used at any time according to the<br/>
discretion of the officiant.<br/>
<br/>
The proper antiphons on pages 43-44 and 80-82 may be used as refrains<br/>
with either of the invitatory Psalms.<br/>
<br/>
Antiphons drawn from the Psalms themselves, or from the opening<br/>
sentences given in the Offices, or from other passages of Scripture may <br/>
be used with the Psalms and biblical Canticles.<br/>
<br/>
Gloria Patri is always sung or said at the conclusion of the entire <br/>
portion of the Psalter; and may be used after the Invitatory Psalm or <br/>
the Canticle &quot;Christ our Passover,&quot; after each Psalm, and after each <br/>
section of <a href="../Psalter/the_psalter.html#119">Psalm 119</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The Gloria printed at the conclusion of certain Canticles may be <br/>
omitted when desired.<br/>
<br/>
The following pointing of the Gloria may be used:</p>

<p>Glory to the Father, and to the Son, *<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and to the Holy Spirit:<br/>
<br/>
As it was in the beginning, is now, *<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and will be for ever. Amen.</p>

<p class="small"">In Rite One services of Morning Prayer and Evening Prayer, the following <br/>
form of the Gloria may be used:</p>

<p>Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, *<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and to the Holy Ghost:<br/>
<br/>
As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, *<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; world without end. Amen.</p>

<p class="small">Metrical versions of the Invitatory Psalms, and of the Canticles after <br/>
the Readings, may be used.</p>

<br/>
<br/>
<p class="rightfoot"><em>Additional Directions</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;141</p>
<hr>
<br/>
<br/>

<p class="small">In special circumstances, in place of a Canticle, a hymn may be sung. <br/>
<br/>
The Apostles' Creed is omitted from the Office when the Eucharist with<br/>
its own Creed is to follow. It may also be omitted at one of the <br/>
Offices on weekdays.<br/>
<br/>
The Lord's Prayer may be omitted from the Office when the Litany or the<br/>
Eucharist is to follow immediately.<br/>
<br/>
In the Intercessions and Thanksgivings, opportunity may be given for <br/>
the members of the congregation to express intentions or objects of <br/>
prayer and thanksgiving, either at the bidding, or in the course of the <br/>
prayer; and opportunity may be given for silent prayer.<br/>
<br/>
A sermon may be preached after the Office; or, within the Office, after<br/>
the Readings or at the time of the hymn or anthem after the Collects.<br/>
<br/>
On occasion, at the discretion of the Minister, a reading from<br/>
non-biblical Christian literature may follow the biblical Readings.<br/>
<br/>
An offering may be received and presented at the Office.</p>

<br/>
<p><em>When there is Communion</em></p>

<p class="small">When Morning or Evening Prayer is used as the Liturgy of the Word at<br/>
the Eucharist, the Nicene Creed may take the place of the Apostles'<br/>
Creed, and the officiant may pass at once from the salutation &quot;The Lord<br/>
be with you,&quot; and its response, to the Collect of the Day. A Lesson <br/>
from the Gospel is always included.<br/>
<br/>
The Intercessions on such occasions are to conform to the directions on<br/>
page 383.<br/>
<br/>
The service then continues with the [Peace and] Offertory.</p>

<br/>
<p><em>Order of Worship for the Evening </em></p>

<p class="small">Before this service, there should be as little artificial light as possible in<br/>
the church. A musical prelude or processional is not appropriate.<br/>
<br/>
When the ministers enter, one or two lighted candles may be carried</p>

<br/>
<br/>

<br/>

<p class="small">before them, and used to provide light for reading the opening Short<br/>
Lesson and Prayer for Light. From Easter Day through the Day of<br/>
Pentecost, the Paschal Candle, if used, should be burning in its customary <br/>
place before the people assemble; the officiant then goes to a place close <br/>
by it to begin the service by its light.<br/>
<br/>
The Short Lessons may be read from any version of the Scriptures<br/>
authorized for public worship in this Church, and should be read without<br/>
announcement or conclusion. When one or more Scripture Lessons are to<br/>
be read later in the service, the Short Lesson may be omitted.<br/>
<br/>
For the lighting of the candles at the Altar and elsewhere, in Easter<br/>
Season the flame may be taken from the Paschal Candle. At other times,<br/>
the candle or candles carried in at the beginning of the service may be<br/>
placed on or near the Altar, and other candles may be lighted from them.<br/>
During Advent, the lighting of an Advent Wreath may take place after<br/>
the Prayer for Light. On special occasions, lighted candles may be<br/>
distributed to members of the congregation.<br/>
<br/>
When this service is used in private houses, candles may be lighted at the <br/>
dining table, or at some other convenient place.<br/>
<br/>
If incense is to be used, it is appropriate after the candles have been<br/>
lighted and while the hymn Phos hilaron is being sung.<br/>
<br/>
When this service continues as a complete Office, Psalms and Lessons<br/>
from the Office Lectionary or the Proper of the Day, or ones suitable to<br/>
the season or the occasion, may be used. Psalms generally appropriate to <br/>
the evening include: <a href="../Psalter/the_psalter.html#8">8</a>, <a href="../Psalter/the_psalter.html#23">23</a>, <a href="../Psalter/the_psalter.html#27">27</a>, <a href="../Psalter/the_psalter.html#36">36</a>, <a href="../Psalter/the_psalter.html#84">84</a>, <a href="../Psalter/the_psalter.html#93">93</a>, <a href="../Psalter/the_psalter.html#113">113</a>, <a href="../Psalter/the_psalter.html#114">114</a>, <a href="../Psalter/the_psalter.html#117">117</a>, <a href="../Psalter/the_psalter.html#121">121</a>, <a href="../Psalter/the_psalter.html#134">134</a>, <a href="../Psalter/the_psalter.html#139">139</a>,<br/>
<a href="../Psalter/the_psalter.html#141">141</a>, <a href="../Psalter/the_psalter.html#143">143</a>. When desired, more than one Lesson may be read, with silence <br/>
or singing between them.<br/>
<br/>
If an additional hymn is desired, it may be sung immediately before the<br/>
Blessing or Dismissal.<br/>
<br/>
When a meal is to follow, a blessing over food may serve as the<br/>
conclusion of this form of service.</p>
