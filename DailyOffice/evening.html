appropriate to the occasion or to the season, may then be read</p>

<p>Jesus said, &quot;You are the light of the world. A city built on a <br/>
hill cannot be hid. No one lights a lamp to put it under a <br/>
bucket, but on a lamp-stand where it gives light for everyone <br/>
in the house. And you, like the lamp, must shed light among <br/>
your fellow men, so that they may see the deed you do, and <br/>
give glory to your Father in heaven.&quot; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em class="small">Matthew 5:14-16</em></p>

<br/>
<br/>

<p>It is not ourselves that we proclaim; we proclaim Christ <br/>
Jesus as Lord, and ourselves as your servants, for Jesus' sake. <br/>
For the same God who said, &quot;Out of darkness let light shine,&quot; <br/>
has caused his light to shine within us, to give the light of r<br/>
evelation&#151;the revelation of the glory of God in the face of <br/>
Jesus Christ. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em class="small">2 Corinthians 4:5-6</em><br/>
<br/>
<p>If I say, &quot;Surely the darkness will cover me, and the light <br/>
around me turn to night,&quot; darkness is not dark to you, O <br/>
Lord; the night is as bright as the day; darkness and light to <br/>
you are both alike. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em class="small">Psalm 139:10-11</em></p>

<p class="rubric" id="prayers">The Officiant then says
the Prayer for Light, using any one of the <br/>
following or some other suitable prayer, first saying</p>

<p>Let us pray.<br/>
<br/>
Almighty God, we give you thanks for surrounding us, as <br/>
daylight fades, with the brightness of the vesper light; and we <br/>
implore you of your great mercy that, as you enfold us with <br/>
the radiance of this light, so you would shine into our hearts <br/>
the brightness of your Holy Spirit; through Jesus Christ our <br/>
Lord. <em>Amen.</em><br/>
<br/>
Grant us, Lord, the lamp of charity which never fails, that it <br/>
may burn in us and shed its light on those around us, and <br/>
that by its brightness we may have a vision of that holy City, <br/>
where dwells the true and never-failing Light, Jesus Christ <br/>
our Lord. <em>Amen.</em><br/>
<br/>
O Lord God Almighty, as you have taught us to call the <br/>
evening, the morning, and the noonday one day; and have <br/>
made the sun to know its going down: Dispel the darkness of <br/>
our hearts, that by your brightness we may know you to be <br/>
the true God and eternal light, living and reigning for ever <br/>
and ever. <em>Amen.</em></p>

<br/>

<p>Lighten our darkness, we beseech thee, O Lord; and by thy <br/>
great mercy defend us from all perils and dangers of this <br/>
night; for the love of thy only Son, our Savior, Jesus Christ. <br/>
<em>Amen.</em><br/>

<p>Almighty and most merciful God, kindle within us the fire of <br/>
love, that by its cleansing flame we may be purged of all our <br/>
sins and made worthy to worship you in spirit and in truth; <br/>
through Jesus Christ our Lord. <em>Amen.</em></p>

<p><em>Easter Season </em></p>

<p>Eternal God, who led your ancient people into freedom by a<br/>
pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night: Grant that <br/>
we who walk in the light of your presence may rejoice in the <br/>
liberty of the children of God; through Jesus Christ our Lord. <br/>
<em>Amen. </em></p>

<p><em>Festivals of Saints </em></p>

<p>Lord Christ, your saints have been the lights of the world<br/>
in every generation: Grant that we who follow in their <br/>
footsteps may be made worthy to enter with them into that <br/>
heavenly country where you live and reign for ever and ever. <br/>

<p class="rubric" id="psalms">The candles at the Altar are now lighted, as are other candles and lamps <br/>
as may be convenient.<br/>
<br/>
During the candle-lighting, an appropriate anthem or psalm may be <br/>
sung, or silence kept.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The following hymn, or a metrical version of it, or some other hymn, <br/>
is then sung </em></font></p>

<p><strong>O Gracious Light</strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Phos hilaron</em></p>

<p>O gracious light, <br/>
pure brightness of the everliving Father in heaven, <br/>
O Jesus Christ, holy and blessed!<br/>
<br/>
Now as we come to the setting of the sun, <br/>
and our eyes behold the vesper light, <br/>
we sing your praises, O God: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.<br/>
<br/>
You are worthy at all times to be praised by happy voices,<br/>
O Son of God, O Giver of Life, <br/>
and to be glorified through all the worlds.</p>

<p class="rubric">The service may then continue in any of the following ways:<br/>

Office or Devotion;<br/>
<br/>
With the celebration of the Holy Eucharist, beginning with the Salutation <br/>
and Collect of the Day;<br/>

hilaron may be followed by the Lord's Prayer and a grace or blessing;<br/>

<p>Blessed are you, O Lord, the God of our fathers, creator <br/>
of the changes of day and night, giving rest to the weary, <br/>
renewing the strength of those who are spent, bestowing <br/>
upon us occasions of song in the evening. As you have <br/>
protected us in the day that is past, so be with us in the <br/>
coming night; keep us from every sin, every evil, and every <br/>
fear; for you are our light and salvation, and the strength <br/>
of our life. To you be glory for endless ages. <em>Amen.</em><br/>
<br/>
Almighty, everlasting God, let our prayer in your sight be as <br/>
incense, the lifting up of our hands as the evening sacrifice. <br/>
Give us grace to behold you, present in your Word and <br/>
Sacraments, and to recognize you in the lives of those around <br/>
us. Stir up in us the flame of that love which burned in the <br/>
heart of your Son as he bore his passion, and let it burn in us <br/>
to eternal life and to the ages of ages. <em>Amen.</em></p>
